       "\"During a demonstration flight, a U.S. Army flyer flown by Orville Wright nose-dived into the ground from a height of approximately 75 feet, killing Lt. Thomas E. Selfridge who was a passenger. This was the first recorded airplane fatality in history.  One of two propellers separated in flight, tearing loose the wires bracing the rudder and causing the loss of control of the aircraft.  Orville Wright suffered broken ribs, pelvis and a leg.  Selfridge suffered a crushed skull and died a short time later. First U.S. dirigible Akron exploded just offshore at an altitude of 1,000 ft. during a test flight. The first fatal airplane accident in Canada occurred when American barnstormer, John M. Bryant, California aviator was killed. The airship flew into a thunderstorm and encountered a severe downdraft crashing 20 miles north of Helgoland Island into the sea. The ship broke in two and the control car immediately sank drowning its occupants. Hydrogen gas which was being vented was sucked into the forward engine and ignited causing the airship to explode and burn at 3,000 ft.. Crashed into trees while attempting to land after being shot down by British and French aircraft. Exploded and burned near Neuwerk Island,  when hydrogen gas, being vented, was ignited by lightning. Crashed near the Black Sea, cause unknown. Shot down by British aircraft crashing in flames. Shot down in flames by the British 39th Home Defence Squadron. Crashed in a storm.

Exploded in midair. A bomb exploded aboard. After failure of all four engines the plane ditched into the Mediterranean Sea. The initial failure of the No. 1 and 2 engines for reasons unknown. Crashed shortly after taking off from Khewra. Possible engine failure. Extremely bad weather forced the captain of the cargo plane to divert from his original destination. No proper preparation had been made for a possible landing at an alternate airfield prior to commencement of flight. The secondary cause was due to the Captain's attempt to execute a landing at Kosti aerodrome which was not equipped with night landing facilities. The Captain landed on the runway but was unable to align himself with the center line and in consequence ran off the runway and struck a steel windsock support and thereafter struck various obstructions such as trees which lay in the path. One of two engines of the aircraft fell into a crowd at a performance at the Farnborough air show. The aircraft crashed to the ground 1.5 miles from the grandstands killing the Chief test pilot of de Havilland Aircraft Corporation, John Derry and an observer, Tony Richards. In addition, fifty two people on the ground were killed and over 60 injured. The cause was a structural design fault in the D shaped leading edge section of the wing. When Derry pulled a high G turn, the wing buckled. The aircraft crashed into an officer's housing area after attemping to make an emergency landing with an engine out,at Anderson Air Force Base on Guam. A navigational error on the part of the captain. This error was severely aggravated by the lack of proper radio aids from the destination airport, the unserviceability of the aircraft R/T equipment, and to a lesser degree the physical condition of the crew. The secondary cause was the cargo plane coming into close proximity of high ground due to the captains uncertainty of his position. Was on air-sea practice when it crashed near Tarbat Ness. After being cleared to land the aircraft struck high ground and burst int flames. Navigational error in not knowing where the aircraft was located. Poor weather. The aircraft crashed into the Sea of Japan while en route. No signs of the wreckage were ever found and only two bodies were recovered when they washed ashore.

The captain took over control from the co-pilot and put the plane into a steep dive. The hijacker did not lose his balance and instead shot and killed the captain. The co-pilot took over control and meanwhile the steward had come up to the cockpit to find out what was going on. As he knocked, the hijacker shot him twice through the cockpit door, killing him. The co-pilot changed course to China and continued at 6000 feet over the China Sea until two Chinese Nationalists T-6 Harvard planes showed up. Both planes chased the DC-3 and sprayed machine gun fire. The pilot managed to escape until he met with other Nationalist planes, who forced the flight to land at Quemoy. At Quemoy the hijacker was arrested. Crashed into approach lights while attempting to land.  Error of judgement on the part of the pilot. The plane crashed into mountains while en route. Upon entering an area of turbulence, the plane was unable to climb and crashed into trees. Found 5 months later.

All 30 passengers were maintenance personnel from the 509th Bomb Wing, noted for dropping the atomibombs on Japan. Accumulation of ice on the surfaces of the aircraft in sufficient magnitude to have caused loss of control. Official cause of loss of control unknown. The pilot aborted the takeoff after loosing the No. 2 engine and was unable to stop on the remaining runway. Error of judgment on the part of the pilot in not continuing the takeoff with three engines still operating Crashed after a wing failed due to metal fatigue cracks after the aircraft encountered strong winds. A wrong type of grease used when fitting press fit bolts to the booms caused corrosion, thus weakening the lower starboard boom at the outboard bolt hole. Lost an engine on takeoff, climbed to 100-200 ft. entering a slight banking turn and crashed into the sea. Failure of the left engine which was due to the cracking of the accessory drive gear. Failure of the pilot to take precautionary steps on hearing the back firing, which was a warning of possible engine failure. The cargo plane crashed on take off.

The aircraft crashed into Cedar Mountain following double engine failure. The progressive failure of both engines, due to the lack of compliance with proper maintenance standards. Spark plugs in both engines had been operated beyond their normal maintenance inspection period and exhibited evidence of a condition conducive to detonation and preignition. There was evidence that detonation and preignition took place in both engines and that  they ultimately failed as a result of master rod bearing failures. Crashed after takeoff due to wing failure. The aircraft descended below minimum altitude and crashed into the sea. The pilot's action in continuing a descent below the 500 ft. prescribed minimum altitude until the aircraft struck the water. A probable contributing factor to the aircraft striking the water was the sensory illusion experienced by the pilots. The aircraft crashed 6 minutes after taking off from Dum Dum Airport. The accident occurred during a violent thunderstorm. Wreckage indicated that the aircraft broke up in the air. Failure of both elevator spars caused by a heavy down-load that may have been associated with a pull-up maneuver. Severe gusts encountered in the thundersquall and overcontrolling or loss of control by the pilots when flying through the thunderstorm. The aircraft was nicknamed 'York Victor.'

Crashed to the ground after an engine fire. While the plane was attempting to land it entered a steep climb, stalled and crashed. The structural failure of the left elevator in flight, causing loss of control. This structural failure was brought about by the left outboard hinge bolt backing out of the assembly. The underlying cause was improper maintenance which resulted in the installation of hinge bolts and bearings not meeting specifications, and inadequate inspection which failed to detect this condition. Loss of engine power on takeoff. The loss of power may possibly be attributed to the heavy deposit of lead on the spark plugs. Cargo plane. Crashed into a ravine. The aircraft crashed a few seconds after becoming airborne. The captain's loss of visual reference and orientation when he encountered drifting fog shortly after becoming airborne on take-off and the resultant inadvertent assumption of a descending flight path.

Crashed while making practice approaches to Ellsworth Air Force Base during its sixth attempt. The plane slammed into to ground with landing gear retracted and flaps set at 20 degrees. Less than a minute after takeoff, the aircraft crashed into a mudbank of the Shannon River. Although the crash site was only about 2,500 metres from the airport, no one was aware of the disaster. Rescue operations were only started after the plane's navigator, after having crossed the river, managed to reach the airport. The aircraft was partially submerged, and at least one of the fuel tanks had ruptured during the crash. The fuel fumes rendered many passengers and crew unconscious, who then drowned in the rising tide. Failure of the captain to interpret his instrument indications properly during flap retraction after the gear was re-extended. The plane was attemping to return to the Rio de Janeiro after severe vibrations in the No. 1 engine made the crew feather the prop.  While on final the aircraft came in too high and a go-around was attempted during which the plane crashed into the sea.

The aircraft crashed as a result of slipping into the ground in the course of a poorly executed steep turn to port, carried out at night at a low altitude. Crashed shortly after taking off after a wing failed. A design flaw in the wing led to fatigue cracks and wing failure. Crashed into a mountain while on approach. Navigational error due to failure to use radio equipment. After taking off from Albuquerque, the aircraft flew a path directly towards Sandia Mountain and crashed into it.  While initially blaming the pilots of intentionally flying the plane into the mountain, five years later, the CAB changed the probable cause to 'deviation from course for reasons unknown' and admitted there may have been a problem with the flux gauge compass. The pilot began taking off and retracted the landing gear when smoke was observed in the cockpit. He attempted to belly land the plane. The propellers separated and penetrated the fuselage killing the fight engineer. The presence of smoke in the flight crew compartment in sufficient quantity to make the captain apprehensive of fire and to cause him to land the aircraft immediately with the landing gear retracted. A fractured rubber hose on the port engine connecting the rocker box of one of the lower cylinders to the collector box caused smoke to enter the wheel well and into the crew compartment. After an aborted landing attempt due to a unlocked landing gear, the plane made a left turn, hit a pole, crashed and burned. Pilot error.

The plane ditched 35 miles off the Oregon coast after the No. 3 engine and propeller broke away causing severe control difficulties. The plane sank after 20 minutes. Loss of control and inability to maintain altitude following failure of the No. 3 propeller which resulted in wrenching free the No. 3 power  package. The aircraft was named 'Clipper United States.' The cargo plane flew into a thunderstorm and crashed into the sea while en route. Suddenly dove into the ground. Unintentional movement of no.4 throttle into the reverse range just before breaking ground, with the other three engines operating at high power output, which resulted in the aircraft very quickly becoming uncontrollable once airborne. An explosion occurred at 18,000 feet while over the China Sea. A resulting fire which started on the starboard wing soon spread and eventually led to total hydrauliand electrical failure. Smoke filled the cockpit and the plane crashed. An act of political terrorism.  An aircraft worker placed an incendiary device in the starboard wheel well. Hit Mt. Kilmanjaro while en route. Wreckage found after 10 months. Crashed after reporting being over Jipe Lake on the slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro. Failure to follow prescribed route and procedures. Ditched into the sea.

On a flight from London, England to Tel Aviv, the aircraft drifted over Bulgarian airspace and was shot down by Bulgarian jet fighters. A navigational error that probably originated with an incorrect radio compass indication due to the effects of thunderstorm activity in the area. The aircraft attempted an emergency landing at a military airstrip after fire broke out in the No. 2 engine. The right wing separated from the aircraft and crashed 1.5 miles from the runway. Installation of an unairworthy cylinder in the No. 2 engine which resulted in an uncontrollable fire and loss of the right wing. Crashed en route. Participating in a U.S. military exercise, the two planes collided in midair while in formation after one of the planes pulled out of formation because of engine trouble. The accident occurred at an altitude of 4,000 feet.  Forty-six aboard 7841 and 20 aboard 3222 were killed. Hit Caparao Mountain while en route, 1 hour after taking off.  Failure to follow flight plan. The cargo plane lifted off too early, stalled and crashed. The pilot tried to avoid a person on the runway. Flew into Mount Popa. The plane returned after failure of the No. 2 engine, stalled and crashed 200 yards short of the runway  into parked aircraft and a hanger.  The captain's commitment to a landing without radio or visual confirmation of his runway alignment following engine failure immediately after takeoff. Crashed into the Cameroon mountains after the wing separated due to severe turbulence. For reasons undetermined, the right engine failed and as a result of being overloaded, the aircraft did not maintain altitude on one engine and struck the ground with the right wingtip. A possible contributing factor was the failure of the co-pilot's vacuum-driven gyro instruments, without his knowledge. Crash landed in a sandstorm on the fourth landing attempt.  The plane came in too low, struck a line of trees and crashed 1,200 yards short of the runway.  Pilot error.  In an error in judgement, the captain who allowed his desire to keep the runway lights in view failed to make adequate reference to his flight instruments.

Abnormal nose-down trim condition which could not be corrected due to an unknown malfunction. Shortly after taking off, the No.1 engine lost power. The crew shut off the hydraulipump which caused the landing gear to stop retracting halfway. The resulting drag, caused the aircraft to lose altitude. The left wing struck a tree and the plane crashed and burned. Failure of the front bearing of the propeller shaft leading to disconnection of the reduction gear and left propeller and causing a sudden failure of the left engine. Cargo plane. An in-flight structural failure resulting from a violent pitch-down induced by the erratiaction of nonconforming elevator tab controls. Crashed on takeoff. The plane crashed while on approach and during an attempted go-around.  The crew allowed the aircraft to deviate to the left of course and descent below the glide path for reasons unknown.  The crew encountered local fog and restricted visibility during the final approach of an ILS approach and missed approach procedure came too late to prevent the aircraft from descending into the ground. Flew into the water upon approach. The pilot relied on inadequate external visual reference for determining the altitude and paid insufficient attention to the instruments. The irregular approach procedure carried out by the pilot in command deprived him of the opportunity to monitor the safe approach to the aerodrome through the correlation of time, height and position. Loss of the No. 2 engine necessitated a forced crash landing near a railway station.  Failure to maintain height at night due to the loss of the starboard engine in icing conditions.  The aircraft was also overloaded. Crashed in the Tatra mountains while en route. The cargo plane was on approach when it crashed.

The aircraft took off from Luqua Airport in Malta bound for England when smoke was seen coming from the left engine.  Shortly thereafter it banked to the left and plunged almost vertically into cliffs.  Engine failure due to cracks in the boost enrichment capsule and the failure of the captain to stop the leftward swing of the aircraft using the rudder. Failure to correct the nose high attitude and failure to feather the No. 1 engine. The flight crashed while on approach 18 miles SE of Cairo.  Pilot's inexperience in ILS approaches.  Improper approach.  Crew error. Crew fatigue. Crashed shortly after taking off 15 miles from Damascus.  Double engine failure during a thunderstorm. Struck  Lash Golath Moutain while en route. An improper flare on landing caused the aircraft to bounce causing the right wing to strike the runway after which the plane veered off the runway. During an instrument approach at night the pilot of the cargo plane permitted the aircraft to descend below the approved safety height and this resulted in the aircraft striking the ground. The cargo plane crashed en route. A downdraft which forced down the fully loaded aircraft to the ground when it was flying under exceptionally severe weather conditions below 1000 ft. and possibly at a few hundred feet above the terrain. The aircraft yawed to the left and crashed shortly after takeoff after a fire warning occurred on the No.1 engine. The cause of the fire warning was a failed exhaust connector clamp in the left engine, which triggered an adjacent fire detecting unit. A windmilling left propeller, the extended landing gear, and the takeoff flaps produced sufficient drag to make the airplane lose altitude and strike the ground. An uncoordinated emergency action in a very short time available to the crew, which produced an aircraft configuration with insurmountable drag. The aircraft experienced extreme buffeting after taking off from Seattle. A decision was made to divert to McChord AFB but the plane continued to loose altitude and had to be ditched in Puget Sound 4.7 nautical miles southwest of Seattle. The plane sank within 15 minutes. The incorrect analysis of control difficulty which occurred on retraction of the wing flaps as a result of the flight engineer's failure to close the engine cowl flaps; the analysis having been made under conditions of urgency and within an extremely short period of time available for decision. Crashed en route from Anchorage to Seward. The pilot's action in continuing flight during instrument weather conditions on a planned VFR flight through a mountain pass and striking a mountainside while attempting to climb out. The plane struck an object in the water while landing and broke up. The aircraft made a sudden turn to the right while talking off from Stansted. Overcorrection by the pilot in command which caused the aircraft to veer to the right. The aircraft touched down at an excessive speed, bounced and stalled. Go-around power was applied, but the remaining runway length was insufficient and the plane overran the end of the runway and went down a steep slope and crashed. The CF-100 was from the Canadian Air Defense Command which was scrambled to investigate an unidentified transport plane flying in the area. Something malfunctioned on the fighter and the jet crashed into a convent operated by the Grey Nuns of the Cross, at over 680 miles an hour, destroying the three story, 70 room convent. Crashed into a mountain shortly after taking off. Loss of height and airspeed caused by the aircraft encountering a thunderstorm cell which gave rise to a sudden reversal of wind direction, heavy rain, and possible downdraught conditions. About 1.5 hours after taking off from New York, the pilot radioed the No. 2 propeller was overspeeding and could not be feathered. Upon trying to return to New York the plane caught fire and crashed into the AtlantiOcean. Vibration resulting from the uncontrollable propeller caused one of the inside wing attachments to loosen or break somewhere between the fuel tank and the dump chute causing an uncontrollable fire. Crashed shortly after taking off from Kano Airport. Flew into a thunderstorm.  Microburst windshear. The TWA aircraft flying from Los Angeles to Kansas City and the United Aircraft flying from Los Angeles to Chicago collided over the Grand Canyon. Both planes were traveling about 320 mph. Both aircraft were flying in uncontrolled airspace. All  fifty-eight on the DC-7 and seventy on the Constellation killed. The pilots did not see each other in time to avoid the collision. It is not possible to determine why the pilots did not see each other, but the evidence suggests that it resulted from any one or a combination of the following factors: 1) Intervening clouds reducing time for visual separation 2) Visual limitations due to cockpit visibility 3) Preoccupation with normal cockpit duties. While on a flight from Chicago to Montreal, cruising at FL190,  the crew was unable to feather an overspeeding No. 4 engine. Soon after the No. 4 propeller broke and one blade disabled the No. 3 engine and  penetrated the fuselage killing a passenger. An emergency landing was successfully made at Windsor, Ontario. Crashed into a wooded area 2 minutes after taking off from McGuire Air Force Base. There was thunderstorm activity at the time. Microburst windshear. Crashed while making an approach to Rio Cuarto. The decision of the pilot to descend en route, without justifiable reason, below the minimum altitude prescribed for a night flight and in weather conditions which made it his duty to follow IFR procedure. Crashed while en route. The aircraft crashed after a missed approach. The crew executing full retraction of flaps without increasing power or changing attitude resulting in loss of lift after the missed approach. The aircraft had to return to Amman for an emergency landing. The landing took place with the gear retracted. The plane bounced, went up a hill and down the other side and burst into flames. Midair collision. Both planes landed safely. Failure of both aircraft to observe and avoid the other aircraft. Crashed while en route. The action of the pilot in flying into conditions of darkness and adverse weather in which he could not maintain adequate control of the aircraft. The plane disappeared over the Atlantiwhile on a flight from Royal Air Force Base in England to McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey. Cause unknown. The aircraft ditched into the PacifiOcean while on a flight from San Francisco to Honolulu after losing the No. 1 and then the No. 4 engine. The aircraft circled around the U.S. Coast Guard cutter 'Pontchartrain', at Ocean Station November until daybreak after which it made a successful ditching with no casualties. Probable Cause: An initial mechanical failure which precluded feathering the No.1 propeller and a subsequent mechanical failure which resulted in a complete loss of power from the No.4 engine, the effects of which necessitated a ditching. The aircraft was named 'Clipper Sovereign of the Sky.' The cargo plane crashed after an attempted go-around. Disappeared while en route. While attempting to land the aircraft descended below the ILS glideslope and hit a tree. Using the lights of the airport the captain misjudged the height he was flying. The aircraft took off, experienced icing, lost altitude and crashed into Hommelfjell Mountain. Unusually heavy icing which the aircraft encountered. Severe downdraft immediately prior to the crash may have been a contributing factor. An unsuccessful belly landing was attempted on flat terrain following a fire in the fuel system. Incorrect use of flying controls during takeoff roll.  Possible failure of left engine. Turbulent conditions close to ground. Hit El Rucio Mountain at 6,200 ft. which was obscured by clouds. Lack of cockpit discipline. Flight on instruments at an excessively low altitude for the route. Crashed into a field shortly after taking off. Lost altitude on takeoff and crashed into a house. Failed to climb for reasons unknown. The aircraft's slight loss of altitude soon after take off was the main cause of the accident. There is no explanation for this loss of altitude. Orchestra and opera conductor Guido Cantelli, 36, among those killed. Struck Silla de Caracas Mountain at 6,700 feet while approaching to land at Maiquetia. Navigation error. The pilot did not follow prescribed approach procedures. St. Louis Cardinal outfielder, Charlie Peete, 27, killed. The starboard engine failed shortly after takoff and  the plane crash into Quetame Hill, 25km northwest of Santa Cecilia  Airport. Complete failure of the starboard engine due to the breakdown of the lubricating system. Recklessness of the pilot in taking off from a closed airport while aware of the poor weather conditions. The aircraft was also overloaded. The aircraft departed Vancouver en route to Calgary. Some 50 minutes later the pilot reported a fire in the No. 2 engine and was turning back. While flying under the power of 3 engines, the aircraft encountered severe icing, turbulence or other difficulty which led to the loss of control by the crew. It could not be determined why the aircraft was 12 miles south of the assigned airway. The plane crashed high into Mount Slesse. The bodies and wreckage were not found until 05/10/1957 and the wreckage still remains at the site which is now a memorial. Crashed in a steep angle of attack. The co-pilot acting as pilot-in-command and under the instruction of the captain began a descent to land until the aircraft hit the ground, left wing first. Both wings detached and the fuselage slid 1,200 feet. The aircraft strayed off the assigned airway and hit a mountain. The pilot did not follow the airways assigned in the flight plan. He did not check his direction and position along the new route. Crashed and burned while attempting to land. Struck trees, hit the ground, and slid 500 ft. after landing short of the runway in rapidly deteriorating condtions.  The captain's lack of alertness in allowing the first officer to continue an instrument descent to an altitude too low to permit terrain clearance. The domestiflight crashed and burned immediately after takeoff from Buenos Aires after overrunning the runway. Too short a runway and excessive cross-winds for the type of aircraft. The aircraft hit Concepcion volcano while en route. The aircraft made a left turn towards the volcano, banked sharply in descent, enered a rapid climb and then crashed. Unexplained loss of control. A first ILS attempt to land at Orly Airport failed. The crew decided to try a second time with GCA guidance. Full power was applied when the crew was not able to see the runway. The aircraft continued to descend impacting the ground in a right bank. The right wing separated and the main fuselage broke-up into four parts. Stalling, as a result of delayed application of power in a final approach configuration and inadequate control of heading, airspeed and altitude after the visual was lost. Midair collision between a DC-7 and F-89J Air Force fighter. The DC-7 crashed into a playground of a school  killing 3 junior high school children 3 miles northwest of Sunland. The F-89 crashed into the mountains. Four crew members on the DC-7 were killed. One crew member aboard the F-89 was killed and  the other ejected to safety. The high rate of near head-on closure at high altitude, which together with physiological limitations, resulted in a minimum avoidance opportunity during which the pilots didn't see each other's aircraft. It was the first test flight of the DC-7B. One of the 3 students killed in the accident was the best friend of singer Richie Valens, who died in an airplane crash two years later. Archie Twitchell, test pilot and actor, 50, killed. The high rate of near head-on closure at high altitude in a minimum aviodance opportunity during which both pilots did not see the other aircraft. Shortly after lifting off from La Guardia Airport in a snowstorm, the plane rolled sharply to the left and crashed on Rikers Island. The failure of the captain to properly observe and interpret his flight instruments and maintain control of his aircraft. Several inmates from the Rikers Island Prison made some heroirescues and were later pardoned. The No. 3 engine seized, causing the propellor to come loose and slice through the side  of the fuselage makng two full turns before exiting. It took two men out with it , idled the No. 4 engine and cut the throttle cable.  While  attempting  an emergency return landing at Kimpo Air Base, level flight could not be maintained and the aircraft descended, crashing into the Han River. Crashed into a densly wooded mountain, 3 miles east of Blyn, while en route to Seattle. Navigation error and poor judgement by the pilot in entering an overcast mountainous area at too low an altitude. The aircraft crashed into trees and farm buildings about a half-an-hour after taking off from Abingdon airfield.  Fuel starvation due to an valve being installed backwards. Pilot did not follow prescribed route nor follow prescribed IFR procedures. The plane suddenly veered and banked to the right while making an approach to land. The plane crashed into houses. Fracture of a 9/16' bolt on the starboard flap due to fatigue led to loss of control of the aircraft. The plane had just taken off from Cebu bound  for Manila when it crashed 20 miles NW of the city. President Ramon Magsaysay, 50, of the Philippines died along with twenty-three others when the plane struck Mt. Manunggal. Magsaysay was on a campaigning trip for reelection. Metal fatigue. Crashed into Andies peak while en route. Wreckage found 100 miles northeast of Cochabamba. Disappeared 200 miles southeast of Tokyo, Japan while on a flight from Travis Air Force Base to Tokyo.  Cause unknown. Shortly after  takeoff, a fire developed in the left main landing gear well. The pilot thought the fire had started in the engine, feathered the No.1 engine and returned for an emergency landing. When he couldn't get the gear down, he performed a go-around after which the left wing separated from the plane. The plane crashed and burned. Fracture of the fuel line in the landing gear housing due to wear against the ribs. Crashed just after takeoff, one mile from the airfield. Engine failure. While en route, fire broke out in the starboard engine. As he lost altitude and because of reduced visibility, the pilot did not see the peak of a mountain. When he tried to pull up the plane stalled and crashed. Engine failure. The accident was due to a maneuvering error which consisted in making two turns onto the Mexico City heading without conforming the distance and procedure specifications and below the prescribed altitudes and speeds. This error was aggravated by a probable shifting of the load due to improper securing. Crashed and burned 5 minutes after taking off from Aqaba. The aircraft lost it's left wing after encountering clear air turbulence. Explosive decompression. A passenger was sucked out of a window at 18,000 feet when the window he was sitting next to shattered. The body was never recovered. Crashed while attemting an emergency return to the airport shortly after taking off. Engine failure. The failure of the captain to maintain height and a safe flying speed when approaching to land on one engine after the failure of the left engine for reasons unknown. The accident is attributed to the insufficient altitude at which the aircraft was flown during an attempt to fly through a thunderstorm. Downdrafts and divergent winds encountered, forced the aircraft to the ground. Crashed while attemping to land. Procedural errors by the pilot. The pilot lost in rain and fog searched for a landing area until the plane ran out of fuel and crashed into a 4,500 foot mountain. Crashed into an ice cap. White-out conditions. Incorrect indication on navigation charts. During a training exercise the aircraft approached a stall entered a spin, partially recovered but crashed. The aircraft descended below safe altitude and struck the ground in rain and poor visibility. The crew's application of an approach procedure other than that prescribed by the airport authority. The stalling of the aircraft following a loss of airspeed, whereupon it unintentionally went into a spin. In view of insufficient altitude, it was not possible to level off the aircraft. Loss of airspeed while executing maneuvers during a training flight, resulting in a stall followed immediately by a spin from an altitude too low to effect recovery. Crashed while attempting an emergency landing after taking off with control difficulties. Jammed elevator. Crew forgot to remove the ground locks. Crashed onto tidal flats off Charlakhi Island during a storm. The pilot asked for clearance to make a low pass over Mokmer to give the passengers a final glimpse of the island. The plane gradually descended over the sea, crashed, burst into flames, broke apart and sank. Crew did not properly monitor their altitude. The plane landed safely after a dynamite bomb exploded in the rear lavatory. A passenger, Saul F. Binstock, 62, a retired North Hollywood jeweler, intent on suicide, detonated a bomb in the rear lavoratory blowing a 6 x 7 ft. hole in the fuselage. Binstock had purchased two insurance policies totaling $125,000 and then flew from Burbank to Las Vegas, where airport personnel at McCarran Field reported he never left the airport terminal. He then boarded the Western Airlines flight bound for Los Angeles and locked himself in the rear lavatory shortly after takeoff. Binstock’s body, missing several fingers on the left hand, was found the next day on a rugged peak in the Ord Mountains south of Daggett. The aircraft en route from Reykjavík to Montreal, Canada was flying at 6,000 ft. when it entered a  thunderstorm. Subsequently it plunged to earth almost vertically at a speed calculated at 230 mph, bursting into flames. Severe turbulence encountered while flying in a cumulonimbus cloud, resulting in a chain of events quickly leading up to a complete loss of control. Crashed into the harbor after hitting the chimney of a factory. While making a sharp turn the cargo plane stalled and crashed. Crashed during takeoff. Strayed off course and collided with a mountain in the Penas Blancas hills.  Pilot error.  Weather's influence on radio communications. Leaving the prescribed route and flying at too low an altitude. The aircraft struck trees to the right and short of the runway during approach in fog. The pilot attempted to make a visual approach by descending prematurely in the approach area without adherence to the prescribed ILS approach procedure which was dictated by existing weather conditions. Flying VFR, the aircraft encountered fog during the approach, undershot the runway and crashed. Pilot error. The pilot did not appreciate that the air ambulance had rapidly lost height whilst he was making a visual half circuit to land. This could not have been due to the absence of sufficient visual reference in the prevailing conditions of darkness, very low cloud and drizzle. The urgent nature of the flight is considered to have influenced the pilot's decision to land. Crashed into the ocean on takeoff. While attempting to land at Belfast, in poor weather, the plane drifted to the right of the runway, overshot the runway and crashed. Cause unknown. Intense fire in the No.1 engine while en route, caused by foreign objects entering from the nacelle. The cargo plane crashed en route. Crashed on a training flight.

In-flight structural fatigue failure of the starboard front lower spar boom. The plane crashed during a storm. Left wing detached in extreme turbulence. The pilot descending on a track well below the minimum safety flight altitude established for this type of operation. The absence in the flight plan of a forecast showing the intensity of the meteorological phenomena encountered. Inadequate operational dispatch of the aircraft. While taking off the plane stalled and hit trees. The uncontrollable stall at low altitude which resulted from the abrupt steep climb immediately after takeoff. Contributing factors were the improper loading of the aircraft and the prevailing gusty wind with a relatively high ambient temperature. The cargo plane crash landed short of the runway on the third landing attempt. The accident was due to an error on the part of the captain in that while making an attempt to land he continued the approach below the critical height without sufficient visual reference to the ground. The aircraft lost all power during a simulated emergency maneuver and struck the water after descending from a altitude of 1,000 ft. One of the crew moved an emergency shut-off lever in the wrong direction depriving all four engines of their fuel supply. The plane hit the water and broke in two. It was ruled the check pilot had failed to initiate remedial action when the aircraft began to lose altitude and failed to exercise authority when the real emergency developed. The flying boat sank in Buenos Aires harbor while trying to make an emergency landing after losing an engine. The cargo plane lost the No. 1 engine on takeoff and crashed. Crashed in mountainous terrain while en route. The plane abandoned the takeoff after an engine failed. The plane was unable to stop and slid off the runway striking rocks and catching fire. Failure of No. 4 engine. Malfunctioning of the starboard brakes. Crashed shortly after taking off. Improper observation and interpretation of instruments. The captain did not properly observe and interpret his flight instruments and thus inadvertently permitted the aircraft to descend to the ground immediately after a night takeoff during which no visual reference was possible. The two aircraft collided at an altitude of 3,000 feet scattering wreckage over a residential and business area of suburban Los Angeles. The C-118 had just taken off from Long Beach Municipal Airport on a transcontinental flight and the P2V was on an instrument training exercise. All 41 killed on the C-118A, six on the P2V and one woman on the ground who was hit by debris outside her house. Pilot error, pilots of both aircraft. The aircraft crashed during takeoff in a snowstorm. The aircraft never lifted from the runway, crashed through the barrier fence and into a house.

ATC error. Another aircraft was permitted to takeoff without the exact position of the plane being known. The DC-7 was en route from Los Angeles to Denver flying at 21,000 ft. The military jet was on a training mission being conducted under VFR. The fighter initiated an evasive maneuver just prior to colliding with the airliner. Both trainee and instructor aboard the F-100 were killed along with all forty-seven aboard the DC-7 airliner. A high rate of near head-on closure at high altitude,  human and cockpit limitations and the failure of Nellis Air Force Base and the Civil Aeronautics Administration to take measures to reduce a known collision exposure as training exercises were allowed to be conducted within the confines of several airways after numerous close calls with military jets had been reported by airline crews for more than a year prior to the tragedy. The aircraft developed trouble in the No. 1 engine while en route from Lisbon to Leopoldville. While attempting to land in poor visibility on 3 engines, the aircraft stalled 80 ft. above the ground and crashed into a building and burst into flames. Pre-crash damage to the No. 1 engine.

During the ensuing forced landing on rough terrain the aircraft broke up and was consumed by fire. Crashed into mountains 100 miles southwest of Algiers. The cargo plane crashed. A hard landing in heavy rain and gusty winds at Manila caused the collapse of the right main landing gear. A prop broke off the No. 3 engine, penetrated the cabin and killed one passenger. The aircraft was named 'Clipper Golden Gate.' The plane crashed into La Latilla mountain 13 km west of Guadalajara. The aircraft did not climb out in accordance with approved procedures. Following the trainee-pilot's failure to maintain minimum-control speed during an attempted go-around, the instructor-pilot failed to take control of the aircraft in sufficient time to prevent a critical loss of altitude. A contributing factor was the malfunction of the landing gear latch which delayed retraction of the landing gear and caused the distraction of the instructor-pilot for several seconds during a critical period of the go-around. Crashed during approach after encountering a downdraft. Missed the runway and collided with a tree. Windshear. While manoeuvring at a low height in mountainous terrain during a supply dropping mission the port wing of the cargo plane grazed the side of a hill thus causing the aircraft to slew and crash.

'The Big Bopper' Richardson, who was suffering from the flu, talked Waylon Jenning into giving up his seat. Ricthie Valens won a coin-toss and went in place of Tommy Allsup. He commented 'I never won anything in my life' after winning the coin-toss. The plane took off into deteriorating weather conditions. The pilot, Roger Peterson, was not certified to fly IFR. The wreckage of the plane was found the next morning in a snowy meadow, 5 miles NW of the airport. The plane hit the ground at a high rate of speed and singers Ritchie Valens, 17, Buddy Holly, 22, Jiles P. 'The Big Bopper' Richardson, 28, as well as the pilot, were killed instantly. It appeared, the pilot became disoriented and flew the plane into the ground.  Officially: The pilot's decision to undertake a flight in which the likelihood of encountering IFR conditions existed, when he was not certified to fly IFR. Also, deficiencies in the weather briefing and the pilot's unfamiliarity with the instrument which determines the attitude of the aircraft. In later years, a story appeared in the Iowa Globe Gazette in which a pilot, Al Potter, flying in the vicinity of the aircraft that night, claimed he was in contact with the aircraft shortly before it crashed. Potter stated the pilot radioed he had taken on ice and was losing power. While attempting to land in rain and fog at La Guardia Airport, the aircraft descended below the minimum altitude and crashed into the East River. The aircraft struck the water while in shallow descent at 150 mph with its landing gear and flaps extended. Primarily the crash resulted from the failure of the crew to properly monitor essential instruments for determining attitude due to preoccupation with particular aspects of the aircraft and its environment. Limited experience of the crew with this particular type of aircraft. Erroneous setting of the captain's altimeter. Possibly misinterpretation of the altimeter and rate of descent indicator. While on approach, the jet lost its wings and had its engines torn off as it ploughed 300 yards through the woods and landed upside down with trees embedded in the mangled fuselage and burst into flames.

Because of the subsequent fire in the aftermath of the crash another 158 persons (28 families) were made homeless. Crashed while en route. Navigational error. The pilot entered a wrong valley and stalled the fully loaded aircraft while attempting to turn back. The trainee captain attempted a maneuver in disregard of the prescribed limitations of such a maneuver. A two-engine overshoot was attempted at a very low height and below the prescribed minimum speed, when the aircraft was committed to a landing. This resulted in a violent yaw and sharp drop which could not be controlled. The training captain was conversant with the minimum requirements of a two-engine overshoot of the Viscount 815 aircraft but appears to have overestimated his performance. The crew failed to recognize and correct the development of excessive yaw which caused an unintentional rolling maneuver at an altitude too low to permit complete recovery. Nineteen minutes after taking off and while climbing, the aircraft entered a cloud and struck Mt. Monseny. Pilot did not follow prescribed regulations. The aircraft descended below MDA and crashed 5 miles short of the runway while on approach to Asuncion. Pilot error. The cargo plane took off, rose to 200 ft., stalled and crashed.

One of two accidents with the same cause. See 3/17/1960. Moments after rotation the left engine exploded and caught fire. The elevator of the plane hit a 12,000 volt powerline and crash landed upright sliding 65 feet. The only fatality was the first officer who was thrown clear of the accident still strapped to his seat. The number 5 cylinder of the left engine failed leading to an explosion that deformed the left engine's ring cowl to a degree that cause excessive drag and buffeting that made sustained flight impossible. Maintenance records showed the engine had a troubling number of oil leaks. Engine failure on takeoff. The plane crashed 5 minutes later. Failure of the gudgeon pin bearing of the No.6 piston of the left engine. Crashed into Bucks Elbow Mountain during an ILS approach to Charlottesville Airport. Navigational omission resulting in an off course approach. It took thirty-six hours before the lone survivor was rescued.

The cargo plane exploded in midair while en route after an engine fire. The aircraft crashed into the Gulf of Mexico at 29 degrees 13 minutes N, 88 degrees 40 minutes W or about 108 miles east-southeast of New Orleans, while on a flight from Tampa to New Orleans. Sabotage (explosion of a bomb aboard) was strongly suspected but could never be proven due to lack of physical evidence.  There is a possibility that there is a connection between this crash and the National Airlines crash of January 6, 1960. No one was charged in either case. Crashed during approach. Shortly after taking off the plane experienced a fire warning in the No. 2 engine, shut it down and attempted to return to Midway Airport. During the final approach the aircraft banked in excess of 45 degrees and developed an excessive sink rate. When the aircraft reached the tops of trees its wings were nearly level and its nose was raised in a climbing attitude but the descent continued and the plane crashed one quarter of a mile southeast of the airport. The accident was the consequence of manuvering the aircraft during the turn to final approach in such a manner as to cause a rate of sink from which recovery was not possible. Sometime during the turn the flaps were retracted from 60% to 24% causing a loss of lift. Crashed into Bald Eagle Mountain,13 miles south of Williamsport,  while on an ILS approach to Williamsport.

Midair collision with a Brazilian Air Force AT-6 Harvard, shortly after takeoff. One killed in the fighter. Failure of both pilots to see and avoid each other. Shortly after takeoff the cargo plane lost the No. 2 engine, tried to return to the airport but crashed. Failure of the right engine, a lack of precaution on the part of the captain and marginal weather. A contributing factor may have been the overloaded condition of the aircraft, however, not to such an extent that it forced the aircraft to descend to a dangerously low altitude. Crashed on takeoff. The cargo plane crashed while dropping supplies and making a narrow turn in a valley. The accident was attributed to an error in navigation which caused the pilot to enter the wrong valley. During an attempt to turn back in a restricted area, the aircraft stalled and crashed. The plane disintegrated in flight at 18,000 feet and crashed 1.5 miles northwest of Bolivia, North Carolina. Detonation of a dynamite bomb by means of dry cell batteries, in the vicinity of row 7, in the passenger cabin.  The plane continued to fly for a short time after which the fuselage came apart and the plane crashed in a ball of flames. Julian Frank, who had purchased 1 million dollars in insurance, was suspected of committing suicide by detonating the bomb in his lap or under his seat. There is a possibility Frank may have been an unwitting bomb carrier and that this bombing has something to do with the National Airlines crash of November, 16, 1959. No one was charged in either case. Missing, never found. The aircraft crashed and burned in a wooded area, striking the ground in a level attitude. The delayed arming of the engine ice-protection systems while flying through icing conditions, causing eventual flame-out of the four engines. This condition existed for sufficient time to cause a drop in battery electrical energy, preventing the unfeathering and relighting of sufficient engines to maintain flight. The aircraft was then dived in an  effort to attain sufficient airspeed to drive the propellers out of the feathered positions by wind-milling.  At the same time, multiple attempts were made to relight one or more engines. Successful relights were either interrupted by auto-feather action initiated by premature advancing of the throttles prior to complete light up of an engine or prevented by insufficient battery electrical energy. No. 4 engine was eventually  relit and the crew had just successfully relit No. 3 engine when the aircraft crashed.

Crashed  into the Tyrrhenian Sea off Elba after penetrating severe thunderstorm. A few seconds after becoming airborne, the aircraft struck a flock of starlings. A number of these birds were ingested in engines No. 1, 2, and 4.  Engine No. 1 was shut down and its propeller was feathered. Engines No. 2 and 4 experienced a substantial momentary loss of power. This abrupt and intermittent loss and recovery of power resulted in the aircraft yawing to the left and decelerating to the stall speed. As speed decayed during the continued yaw and skidding left turn, the stall speed was reached; the left wing dropped, the nose pitched up, and the aircraft rolled left into a spin and fell almost vertically into the water. An altitude of less than 150 feet precluded recovery. Hit Mt. Capanne while en route.  Cause unknown. The right wing of the cargo plane separated from the aircraft at 6,500 ft.

A collection of water was found in the fuel tank booster pump. Crashed on takeoff. Failure of the No. 1 engine shortly after take-off but after V2. Inappropriate emergency procedures by crew. Unable to gain altitude, the aircraft crashed into power cables during takeoff. Crashed into woods while attempting to land. Both pilots tested positive for alcohol.  In addition, the pilot did not have enough sleep the night before and was not considered to be in satisfactory mental and physical condition to undertake the flight. An aborted takeoff caused the aircraft to crash through the airport barrier fence and burst into flames. The unnecessary discontinuance of the takeoff as a result of actions by the check-pilot who was either not in the pilot's seat or reached forward without warning and pulling the throttles back. This action caused power to be decreased on all four engines. Contributing factors were the marginally poor weather, snow on the runway and the possibility of the pitot head heat not being on.

Lost an engine, stalled and crashed. Five minutes after taking off from Lisbon, Portugal, the aircraft plunged into the AtlantiOcean. There were indications from the wreckage that the aircraft went into a spiral dive and hit the water at over 500 mph. Either through inattentiveness or loss of an artificial horizon or other instrument malfunction, the aircraft went into a steep left bank from which recovery was not possible. Attitude of the aircraft at the moment of impact pointed to over correction. Crashed into power lines during the approach, 4 km short of the runway. Crew's neglect to cockpit duties. Error in judgement on the part of the captain, who, after sighting the runway lights, concentrated on keeping them in sight and failed to make adequate reference to his flight instruments. As a result, he allowed the aircraft to descend below the obstacle clearance limit of 360ft.  In the darkness, with no ground reference, the runway lights gave him insufficient guidance as to his height and angle of approach and he was unaware that the aircraft had descended to ground level. The fatigue of the captain and the failure to illuminate the aircraft's landing lights were conributing factors. Crashed into a trees and telegraph poles on final approach.The pilot failed to follow the instrument approach procedures during the approach. Hit apporach lights while trying to land in heavy rain. Following takeoff from Omaha, hydraulidifficulties were experienced. The flight was continued to Denver where the aircraft experienced asymmetrical reverse thrust while landing and crashed into a maintenance truck and burned.

The aircraft was allowed to descend too low, resulting in striking trees and crashing. Although the United Nations released a statement that no evidence of sabotage was found, rumors persist about this accident alleging that the victims were shot prior to the crash or that a bomb onboard exploded. Takeoff and Initial climb appeared to be normal, but at approximately 200 feet a shallow turn to the right continued into a gradually increasing bank of about 85 to 90 degrees. While in the turn, the crew made a short, garbled transmission indicating alarm. During the latter part of the turn a gradual descent began and, two minutes after taking off, the aircraft struck the ground. Mechanical failure in the aileron primary control system due to an improper replacement of the aileron boost assembly, resulting in a loss of lateral control of the aircraft at an altitude too low to effect recovery.

The cargo plane cashed while attempting to land. Shifting cargo. Shortly after taking off from Esenboga Airport, the aircraft assumed an excessively steep climbing angle, stalled and crashed. The probable cause of the accident was the obstruction of the pitch pointer in the captain's director horizon which led him to make an excessively steep climb. One of three screws had worked its way loose and blocked the pointer on the dial from indicating the correct pitch. The cargo plane's right wing tip struck a wall and then the plane crashed into a tree. Pilot error in failing to discontinue takeoff, even after the right wing tip hit the well and broke off, while the aircraft was on the ground during the takeoff run. Crashed on takeoff.

After taking off from Idlewild Airport and reaching a height of 1,500 feet, the aircraft made a left turn but continued to roll until it was inverted and crashed into Jamaica Bay approximately 3 miles southwest of the control tower. A rudder control malfunction which caused  a full unwanted rudder deployment, yaw, sideslip and roll which led to loss of control of the aircraft. This was caused by the use of an improper tool at the manufacturing plant to wrap the rudder servo unit's wiring, damaging the wires and leading to a short circuit. There is speculation that the accident was actually caused by the captain putting the aircraft in a steep 45 degree bank which resulted in the loss of control of the aircraft. The aircraft had a unusually long take-off run and appeared to gain altitude with difficulty. One and one-half miles from the runway the aircraft struck trees and crashed into a tidal swamp and burst into flames.  A jammed right elevator spring tab caused the crew to lose of control of the aircraft. Crashed into a mountain.

Improper in-flight decisions or planning. Poor crew coordination. Improper emergency procedures. Crashed after rear engine mount failed leading to inflight failure. Cashed in poor weather. Misjudgment of the terrain clearance, which resulted in the collision with trees in severe turbulence and strong gusty winds. The incurrence of reverse thrust during simulated failure of no. 4 engine on takeoff. That condition arose when very rapid rearward movement of the power level generated an inertia force which caused the associated thrust brake lever to rise and enter the reverse idle detent. After lift-off, the minimum control speed essentially required to overcome the prevailing state of thrust imbalance was never attained and an uncontrollable roll, accompanied by some degree of yaw and sideslip in the same direction, ensued. When the condition of reverse thrust was recognized and eliminated, insufficient time and height were available to allow the aircraft to recover from its precarious attitude before it struck the ground. The aircraft stalled during an emergency single engine approach. Both engines failed as the approach continued. The plane came to rest in a shallow pond on the golf course. Fuel starvation. Mismanagement of  fuel. Pro golfer Tony Lema and his wife, Betty, was killed. He was on a Buick promotional tour.

Struck a hill while simulating an engine failure. An overspeeding and failed attempt to feather the No. 1 engine necessitated ditching the plane. The plane sank after 5 minutes.  One passenger refused to leave the aircraft and drowned. About 150 miles from Longreach, fire was reported in No. 1 and 2 engines. While the plane was making an emergency descent, the left wing broke away due to weakening by the fire. After failure of the wing, the plane broke up in mid-air and crashed. Loosened bolts led to the loss of the oil lubricating unit causing the bearings to heat and catching the engines on fire. Subsequently, a locking mechanism was installed on the bolts to prevent any future accidents of this kind. The cargo plane struck trees at the end of the runway after trying to make an emergency landing. Material failure consisting in fatigue failure of a number of teeth of the pinion of the governor control unit, which was jammed against the rack in the 'up' position and therefore set for maximum rpm, thus causing the engine to overspeed. This would be in keeping with the fact that the dome ring was at maximum low pitch setting, i.e. high rpm and a runway propeller on take-off. The plane crashed into Salmon Mountain while on approach to Portland. The pilots evidently had agreed to maintain 9,000 feet, but descended instead. The aircraft hit the mountain at the 3,830-foot level of a 4,090-foot ridge. The crew's descent  below its clearance limit and below that of surrounding obstructing terrain for reasons unknown.

The crew did not set the altimeters in the final approach according to the instructions in the operations manual. This error was aggravated by the fact that the final approach check list did not coincide with the altimeter setting procedure. In consequence the crew unintentionally flew below critical height and the aircraft collided with trees when the altimeters were showing approx. 200 ft. above the critical height. Crashed into building while landing. Crashed into hill while on approach. Improper procedures used by crew. Pilot misjudged altitude and distance and crashed into a mountain at 8,800 ft.

The DC-9 was traveling at almost 300 mph at low altitude in airspace occupied by numerous small planes. The contributing factor to the accident was the excessive speed of the DC-9.  ATC systems inadequate to separate controlled and uncontrolled traffic. After this accident, the FAA imposed a maximum speed of 250 knots below 10,000 ft. mean sea level. Crashed and exploded  while en route. The aircraft struck the northwestern slope of Stukel Mountain just after takeoff. Loss of control due to ice accretion on airframe surfaces. The pilot should have required that de-icing fluid be applied prior to takeoff. Flew into Colcanin Mountain in heavy fog while en route. Crashed into the sea.

Series of errors by the crew due to intoxication by carbon monoxide fumes. Difficulty in communication between the ATC and crew due to lack of phraseology. The aircraft crashed a during a landing attempt. Loss of power in both starboard engines resulting in control difficulties. Fuel starvation due to inadvertent fuel transfer. Inadvertent fuel transfer in flight on a scale sufficient to involve the risk, after a long flight, of emptying the tank expected to contain sufficient fuel can occur if the fuel selector levers in the cockpit of this type of aircraft are incorrectly positioned by even a small amount. This is easy to do and difficult for the pilot to recognize. Broke-up in mid air. The pilot attempted an overshoot maneuver, following the stoppage of the port engine, at too low a speed (below the minimum control speed) resulting in an uncontrollable turn towards the Airport buildings. Crashed into a residential neighborhood while attempting to return to the airport following an engine failure. The pilot became lost and ran out of fuel crashing into a swamp.

Shortly before reaching V1, the nose gear tire blew causing severe vibration. The crew aborted the takeoff and overran the runway into the sea. Loss of directional control developing from separation of the right nose wheel tread.  Inability to stop within the normally adequate runway distance available due to use of differential braking, impaired performance and an increase in tail wind component and aircraft weight over those used in calculating the aircraft's acceleration /stoping performance. While on the takeoff roll a loud bang was heard as the aircraft passed a Delta plane and the takeoff was aborted. The aircraft overran the runway and crashed and burned. The inability of the TWA crew to abort successfully their takeoff at the speed attained prior to the attempted abort. The abort was understandably initiated because of the first officer's belief that his plane had collided with a Delta aircraft stopped just off the runway. A contributing factor was the action of the Delta crew in advising the tower that their plane was clear of the runway without carefully ascertaining the facts, and when in fact their aircraft was not a safe distance under the circumstances of another aircraft taking off on that runway. The plane climbed to 700 ft. and crashed into the ground. Malfunctioning artificial horizon and compass. The aircraft struck a tree short of the runway during an approach in snow. Procedural errors by the crew during the approach in adverse weather. The visual approach conducted at night and in deteriorating weather conditions without adequate altimeter cross-reference.

Crashed in icing conditions at a low altitude. Evasive maneuver to avoid trees. Pilot not instrument rated. Continued VFR flight into adverse weather conditions. Struck a mountain. Icing The cargo plane crashed on takeoff. The failure of the crew to perform a pre-takeoff control check resulting in takeoff with the elevators immobilized by a control batten. During poor weather and after a flyby, the pilot requested a Runway 18 approach. The pilot decided to make a visual approach along the middle of 3 diverging roads, which was aligned with the runway. Because of the fog, the pilot began his approach along the third road which extended to the Royal Thai Air Force fuel storage instead of Runway 18. When the aircraft got close to the ground, the pilot realized that he was approaching the wrong road. He tried to initiate a go-around but the aircraft became unstable as he raised the nose slipped to the left and stalled the plane. The No.1 engine hit the ground first, 200 meters from the airport. The aircraft crashed during a go-around after a failed landing attempt. Undetermined. Pilot may have suffered a heart attack. Engine failure on takeoff. Pilot used improper emergency procedures. Used minimum takeoff run and takeoff speed. Executed steep climb and turn at 50 ft. Non-instrument rated pilot attempted night flying in IFR conditions. Spatial disorientation. Continued VFR flight into adverse weather conditions. Crashed into a mountain south of Dong Ha airfield. The aircraft hit Mt. Tobin 300 ft. below the peak and slid 1,000 ft. down the side of the mountain. Turbulent conditions caused the uncontrolled descent. The pilot was not qualified for the type of aircraft and should not have continued the flight. Ice accretion on the lifting surface of the aircraft accompanied by moderate to severe turbulence, which resulted in loss of aircraft control by the pilot. When he tried to regain control over the aircraft the lifting surfaces were loaded beyond approved design limits, which brought about the disintegration of main parts of the aircraft in the air, and its subsequent impact with the ground. Crashed into Kamegamori Mountain, near border between Ehime and Kouchi. Rotated too early, stalled and crashed during a snowstorm. Touched down on the right side of the runway, bounced, crashed into landing lights and into the sea.  Inadequate supervision of the flight by the pilot-in-command.

Engine failure on climb out for undetermined reasons. Aircraft allowed to enter condition of asymmetrical thrust. Improper emergency procedures. Aircraft overloaded by 475 lbs. The plane landed in the shallow waters of San Francisco Bay, 2.5 mile short of the Runway 28L. All 107 people aboard were safely evacuated off the plane without injury. According to the NTSB, the captain said he was making a coupled approach, but because of problems with his pressure altimeter, he was relying on the more accurate radio altimeter for verification of altitude. The captain looked up expecting to be 200 feet above the water but instead was nearly in the water. He applied power but it was too late. The captain did not cross-check the raw data glide-slope signals and didn't realize the ILS on-course position was far above where he was. The  improper application of the prescribed procedures to execute an automatic-coupled ILS approach. This deviation from the prescribed procedures was, in part, due t o a lack of familiarization and infrequent operation of the installed flight director and autopilot system.  As a result, Japan Air Lines changed their training procedures to stress command responsibilities, crew coordination and transition time for new type of aircraft. The aircraft was recovered from the San Francisco Bay 55 hours after the accident, repaired at a United Air Lines facility and eventually flow back to Japan where it was put  in service for many decades.

Several other members of the band were seriously injured. Fuel exhaustion due to crew inattention of the fuel supply. Contributing factors were improper flight planning and a malfunction in the No.2 engine which caused a higher than normal fuel consumption. After lifting a water container the aircraft began rotating until control was lost and contact was made with the ground, shearing off the tail rotor and a large portion of the tail assembly. New engines were installed in the CH-53s to increase the power of the main rotor and on a whole to make the helicopter more powerful. However, it was soon evident that the tail rotor could not balance the increased power created by the main rotor. Under certain conditions the aircraft would become unstable and lose directional heading. Sikorsky warns of these conditions. To compensate for the mistake that had been made, Sikorsky designed and tested a bell crank system to stabilize the rear rotor. After seven years, this helicopter was still not retrofitted with the bell crank system. Gross weight of the container exceeded the lifting capacity of the helicopter.

While in a holding pattern because of electrical problems the cargo plane cashed into 7,600 ft. mountain. The approach controller's issuance and the flight crew's acceptance of an incomplete and ambiguous holding clearance in combination with the flight crew's failure to adhere to prescribed impairment-of-communications procedures and prescribed holding procedures. The controller's and flight crew's actions are attributed to probable habits of imprecise communication and of imprecise adherence to procedures developed through years of exposure to operations in a radar environment. Contributing to the accident was the failure of the aircraft's No.1 electrical system for unknown reasons. The plane made a forced landing in the ocean. Fuel exhaustion.

An engine failure was followed by a wide banking turn and crash to the ground bursting into flames. The aircraft crashed shortly after taking off from Richland after climbing to 400 feet and stalling. Crew error.  The failure and inability of the flightcrew to prevent rapid pitchup and stall by exerting sufficient push force on the control wheel. The pitchup was caused by the combination of a mistrimmed horizontal stabilizer and a center of gravity near the aircraft's aft limit. The mistrimmed condition resulted from discrepancies in the aircraft's trim system and the flightcrew's preoccupation with making a timely departure. The out-of-trim warning system was inoperative. The aircraft touched down just as the crew noticed a snow plow on the runway. A go-around was initiated but the thrust reverses did not stow away properly because hydraulipower was automatically cut off at lift-off.  The aircraft missed the plow, overran the runway, crashed and burned. Estimated time of arrival given by Calgary ATC in error. Crew did not report over its final approach beacon.

The aircraft crashed while attempting a non-precision instrument approach to Pensacola and landed in 12 feet of water, 3 nm short of the runway. Failure of the crew to monitor altitude and descent rate and the failure of the 1st officer to provide the captain with the required altitude and approach performance call-outs. Also the flight engineer disabled the GPWS alarm so the crew could hear one another better. In addition, the night flight had been diverted from its primary airport due to poor weather and was required to execute a compressed approach (descending and approaching more quickly and steeply than normal), and the crucial altimeter readout was an old drum-roll-counter type (due to be replaced), which could easily be misread, especially in  heavy workload situations. Three fatalities occurred when the frightened passengers grabbed their seat cushions and exited the plane from the rear. They drowned in part because their seat cushions were not flotation cushions. The airplane was not required to have floatation cushions because it was not flying over water. Crashed in mountains. The flight engineer accidentally shut off the automatitransferring of fuel from the sump tank. Eventually all three engines stopped and the plane crashed. Fuel starvation. Crashed in heavy fog while attempting to take off. The aircraft overran the runway and crashed into a revine after an aborted takeoff due to a blown tire.

Two-hundred-forty-four members of the 101st Airborne Division from Fort Campbell, Kentucky  were killed in the accident. There is controversy surrounding this crash. The majority opinion of the board was that the cause of the sequence leading up to the stall and crash could not be determined, with icing a possibility. The minority opinion was that the crash was possibly caused by detonation of an explosive device of unknown origin in a cargo compartment which led to an in-flight fire and loss of control of the aircraft. The plane crash landed into a field and struck a pole then continued into trees after dense smoke filled the plane and cockpit. The fire most likely started in a defective cabin heater but was not determined for sure. Singer Rick Nelson, 45, fiancée Helen Blair, 27, soundman Clark Russell and the members of his back-up group The Stone Canyon Band, Andy Chapin, 20, Rick Intveld, 22, Bobby Neal, 38, and Patrick Woodward, 35 were killed.

Failure of Aloha Airline's maintenance program to detect the presence of disbonding and fatigue damage which led to failure of the lap joint at S-10L and the separation of the fuselage upper lobe. Contributing factors were the failure of Aloha Airline's management to properly supervise its maintenance crew as well as the failure of the FAA to properly evaluate the Aloha Airlines maintenance program and to assess the airline's inspection and quality control deficiencies. In addition the maintenance program underestimated the need for inspections with the large number of pressurizations/depressurizations and humid salt air climate the plane was subjected to. Crashed into a hillside during approach in foggy weather. The plane struck the rock face of a 8,600 ft. mountain in poor visibility. Pilot did not maintain proper altitude. Flight into known adverse weather. Poor inflight planning. The aircraft encountered heavy rain and hail which resulted in flame-out of both engines. Attempts to restart engines were unsuccessful. The aircraft landed safely in a grassy field between a drainage ditch and levee with no power. Water ingestion due to heavy rain from a level 4 thunderstorm caused failure of both engines. A contributing cause of the incident was the inadequate design of the engines and the FAA water ingestion certification standards which did not reflect the waterfall rates that can be expected in moderate or higher intensity thunderstorms. The cargo plane crashed. While landing the cargo plane pitched up for a go-around causing cargo to shift and the plane to lose control and crash. Crashed into mountains. The plane crashed and burned while practicing touch-and-go landings. The airliner crashed 3 miles short of the runway in poor visibility. Crew's overconfidence and  incorrect in-flight planning. The plane was scheduled to perform a series of fly-bys at an air show. The plane was to descend to 100 ft. altitude with landing gear and flaps extended. The automatigo-around protection (Alpha Floor Function) was inhibited for the maneuver. During the maneuver, the plane descended thru 100 ft. to an altitude of 30 feet and hit trees at the end of the runway. The aircraft was totally destroyed by the successive impacts and violent fire which followed. The pilot allowed the aircraft to descend through 100 ft. at slow speed and maximum angle of attack and was late in applying go-around power. Unfamiliarity of the crew with the landing field and lack of planning for the flyby. The civilian Iranian airliner was shot down by the U.S. Navy vessel U.S.S. Vincennes with surface-to-air missiles. The Vincennes was protecting other civilian ships in the area from Iranian gunboats. The Vincennes responded to hostile action taking place against a ship by Iranian gun boats. However, orders to the captain were to send a helicopter to investigate but maintain position. In fact, the ship headed towards the hostilities and penetrated 2nm inside Iranian territorial waters and after the helicopter was fired upon, engaged the enemy boats. The ill-fated airliner was delayed in leaving Bandar Abbas because of a problem with the passport of a passenger. Soon after taking off the target appeared on the radar of the Vincennes. Because the plane was late and confusion of time zones, the crew was not expecting an airliner in the area. When the target was first identified, it squawked both 2 (military) and 3 (civilian). The reason for this was the radar tracker ball was left in the vicinity of the Bandar Abbas airport and the radar was picking up both the airliner and a military F-14 jet fighter at the same time. Playing it safe, the plane was misidentified as a F-14 Iranian fighter. The aircraft did not respond to 10 radio challenges from the Vincennes. However, 7 were on military frequencies which the airliner could not pick up. Three were on the civil emergency frequency addressed to the so called military F-14. When the plane was nearing 10 miles from the ship, it was reported to the captain that the aircraft was descending. At that time the surface-to-air missiles were fired destroying the aircraft. At the inquiry computer data showed that the plane was never descending and actually was ascending at a steady rate. Incredibly, a military investigation concluded that although the U.S. government regretted the loss of human life, the captain and crew were not at fault and acted properly in shooting down the airliner. Shortly after taking off the crew experienced failure of the No. 4 engine and a fire. While attemping to return to the airport control was lost and the plane crashed. The cargo plane ran out of fuel and crashed into a dirt bank . Fuel starvaion. Open drain valve inside the No. 4 engine led to the loss of fuel. Crashed on approach.

Musician Paul Jeffreys killed. The aircraft was named 'Clipper Maid of the Seas.' While landing the cargo plane pitched down and crashed short of the runway. A loss of control due to the improper in-flight decisions by the crew and the undetected accumulation of ice on the leading edge of the horizontal stabilizer, during flight in a forward centre of gravity condition and exacerbated by the extension of full landing flaps. While en route and climbing through FL 280, a vibration was felt and the smell of smoke was detected.  A fan blade on the No. 1 engine detached and caused a compressor stall and vibration of the aircraft. The crew throttled back the No. 2 engine and the vibration stopped. Soon after it was decided to shut down the No. 2 engine. While attempting to land, power was lost in the No. 1 engine, the aircraft stalled and crashed into trees 3,000 ft. short of the runway. The crew mistakenly shut down the wrong engine, lost power in the disabled engine and was unable to maintain flight in the final approach. After gaining altitude the cargo plane descended until it impacted trees. Improper IFR procedure by the first officer during takeoff, his lack of instrument scan, his failure to maintain a positive rate of climb or to identify the resultant descent, and the captain's inadequate supervision of the flight. Contributing factors were: dark night, low ceiling, drizzle, the first officer's lack of total experience in the type of operation, and possible spatial disorientation of the first officer. The plane went missing en route. Crashed about 500 ft. short of the runway. Crashed in flames after taking off from Dyess Air Force Base. Failure of the water injection system during takeoff.

The airliner hit a mountain while attempting to land at Santa Maria. The crew mistakenly continued to descend through 3,000 ft. which it was clear to. Because of a overlap in communications, the tower did not notice the mistake. The aircraft continued to descend and did not comment or react to warnings from the GPSW for 7 seconds. The aircraft then hit Pico Alto mountain at an altitude of 2,000 ft.  Procedural errors by the flight crew and ATC. Descent of the aircraft below minimum sector altitude. Transmission from the tower of a QNH value higher than the actual value. Crashed after experiencing engine failure on takeoff. The cargo plane descended below minimums and impacted trees and a hill. Non-standard phraseology used by Kuala Lumpur ATC, causing the crew to misinterpret the instructions. The accident occurred during a descent when the aircraft collided with a 2,060 ft. mountain. The pilot's failure to properly preflight and plan for flight and his intentional flight into imconditions. Pilots disregard for in-flight weather advisories. Factors contributing to the accident were the low ceiling conditions in conjunction with the mountainous terrain. After leaving Honolulu, on a flight from Los Angeles to Sydney, Australia, the loss of an improperly latched foward lower lobe cargo door resulted in explosive decompression and loss of power in the No. 3 and 4 engines. Nine passengers were sucked out of the plane and lost at sea. The plane landed safely. The cargo door opening was attributed to a faulty switch or wiring in the door control system which permitted electrical actuation of the door latches towards the unlatched position after initial door closure and before takeoff. Hit high ground 27 km from the airport. The cargo plane crashed after its initial climb. While flying from Thunder Bay, Ontario to Winnipeg, Manitoba, the plane crashed on take-off from Dryden, Ontario. The aircraft failed to gain altitude, settled back down on the runway and then took off for a second time clipping the tops of  trees, causing debris to clog the engines leading to the plane crashing. The aircraft was being refueled with one engine running because of an unserviceable APU. Since no external power unit was available at the airport the engine could not be shut down and deicing could not be performed. The captain's decision to take off  in deteriorating weather conditions with an accumulation of snow and ice on the wings.  Decision not to de-ice the plane before taking off. The failure of the Canadian air transport system in placing the crew in a situation where they did not have the resources to make a proper decision. Crashed after striking radio tower while on approach. The loss of control of the airplane for undetermined reasons following the in-flight opening of the improperly latched cargo door. Contributing to the accident were inadequate procedures used by Evergreen Airlines and approved by the FAA for pre-flight verification of external cargo door lock pin manual control handle, and the failure of McDonnell Douglas to provide flight crew guidance and emergency procedures for an in-flight opening of the cargo door. Also contributing to the accident was the failure of the FAA to mandate modification to the door-open warning system for DC-9 cargo-configured airplanes, given the previously known occurrences of in-flight door openings.

The aircraft was making a night, VOR instrument approach to Runway 28.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, except for some parts of the airport which were obscured by low cloud.  Approaching Runway 28, the aircraft was too high to land and the pilot chose instead to enter a right downwind to land on Runway 10.  At approximately 400 feet above ground level on final for Runway 10, the aircraft entered some clouds, the base of which were reported by the tower operator to be at 10 meters.  The aircraft continued its descent, initially striking some trees about 400 feet short of the runway, then shearing off one of the main landing gear on a hillside road about 200 feet prior to the runway.  The aircraft, under full power and nose up, began to climb, but rolled inverted and crashed at the threshold of Runway 10.  The wing fuel tanks were ruptured and the fuselage, trailing fire, slid across the runway and stopped on the parallel taxiway.  A fire ensued and airport fire and rescue crews put out the fire within 10 minutes.  Both pilots and one passenger were killed by impact and the remaining four passengers were taken to the hospital with moderate injuries.  The primary cause of the accident was the pilot's decision to descend without visual reference to the surface.  A contributing factor was the negative affect on crew performance that resulted from not using oxygen at 12,000 feet during the flight from Ciudad Guayana. Crashed into the sea 4 miles Northwest of the Island. Unknown cause. There was sever turbulence and windshear in the area. The crew inadvertently selected 'Beta Range' on the propellers at 800 feet.

El Saluda at 5,000 ft., near Image, after announcing a go-around with intentions of diverting to their alternate. The aircraft was observed sinking fast while attempting to land at Pasco. The aircraft suddenly nosed over and crashed short of the runway. The crew's decision to continue an unstabilized instrument landing system approach that led to a stall, most likely of the horizontal stabilizer, and loss of control at low altitude. Contributing to the accident was the air trafficontroller's improper vectors that positioned the aircraft inside the outer marker while it was still well above the glideslope. Contributing to the stall and loss of control was the accumulation of airframe ice that degraded the aerodynamiperformance of the airplane. Crashed in poor weather conditions. Rumors suggest the plane was shot down. Midair collision. Five killed on ZA-DAX, ZK-DQF landed safely.

Twenty minutes later the plane went into a steep dive and crashed to the ground. The flight crew became incapacitated for undetermined reasons and lost control of the airplane. Crashed into El Junquito Hill 5 minutes after taking off and burned. Most likely cause was reduced visibility, rain and low overcast. The aircraft was put in a series of extended holding patterns as it approached New York.The crew informed ATC they were running out of fuel but did not declare an emergency and were cleared to land. After a missed approach and during  a go-around, the plane ran out of fuel and crashed in a wooded area. The captain speaking very little English and communicating through the first officer, at no time declared an emergency. The first officer used the term 'we need priority' several times, rather than declaring an emergency. The ATC did not realize the peril of the aircraft. Failure of the crew to properly communicate the emergency situation to the ATC. Although blame was placed squarely on the crew there are several reasons why ATC should have  taken some responsibility for the accident. ATC was trying to land too many planes at once given the weather and number of missed approaches and aborted landing that were taking place. The plane was put in an extended holding pattern on three different occasions. The crew was not told of wind shear below 500 ft. which led to the aborted landing attempt. The plane was passed between three different controllers as it came out of its holding pattern to land. Each time the crew had to repeat their fuel situation.  The crew did say 'we are running out of fuel' numerous times only to be taken on a wide circling pattern after the first attempt at landing was aborted. Although the major blame was placed on the crew, in the end, the FAA paid 40% of compensations to the passenger's families. Crashed into Mt. Ringani after being diverted en route to Denpasair, Bali, due to bad weather. Rain and high winds caused the aircraft to crash 50 miles from it's destination of Brazzaville. In light snow, the cargo plane was unable to gain altitude and crashed into trees. The failure of the pilot to de-ice the airplane prior to departure, and his decision to make the takeoff at a weight that exceeded both the maximum structural takeoff weight and the reduced takeoff weight allowed for icing conditions resulting in an inadvertent stall. The cargo plane took off at night in snow was unable to gain altitude, make a steep descent and crashed into trees. Loss of control in-flight after the airplane stalled during climbout. The stall resulted from a loss of lift due to a contaminated wing surface. Contributing to the accident was the failure of the pilot to de-ice the aircraft prior to departure. Crashed after an aborted landing following landing  too fast and 2/3rds down the runway. The pilot attempted a go-around, became airborne but stalled and crashed into houses and a car killing two people. On final approach, the aircraft descended below the normal approach profile until it hit the ground 2,300 ft. short and 200 ft. to the right of the runway centerline. The co-pilot's (in this case check captain's) flight director was left in the Open Descent Idle Mode instead of the Vertical Speed Mode, the prescribed setting for an approach and landing.The aircraft could not maintain the correct flight path at idle power. Failure of the crew to realize the gravity of the situation and respond immediately towards proper action of moving the throttles, even after the radio altitude call-outs. Suddenly dove into a field as it prepared to land at Likouala. While on an ILS approach, the cargo plane encountered icing conditions. Subsequently it entered a steep descent and crashed short of the runway. The accumulation of structural ice and subsequent stalling of the aircraft. The icing condition was a related factor. After the pilot ejected safely, the aircraft crashed into two trucks killing 50 people on the ground. The pilot of the helicopter heard a loud noise followed by loss of engine power. He entered an autorotation, deployed emergency floats and successfully landed on the water. However, a wave turned the helicopter over.  All successfully got out of the aircraft but one passenger died from drowning 8 hours later and the other 15 hours later.

Failure of the crew to follow prescribed procedures. Immediately after liftoff, the stick shaker activated. The takeoff was aborted but the aircraft ran off the runway and caught fire. A defective stall warning system. A design flaw that allowed the defective stall warning system to go undetected. Failure of TWA's maintenance program to correct a repetitive malfunction of the stall warning system, and inadequate crew coordination between the captain and first officer that resulted in their inappropriate response to a false stall warning. After experiencing difficulty in deploying the flaps while approaching Katmandu, the landing was aborted.  The ATC did not have radar service. After some confusing exchanges between the tower and the aircraft, the crew headed north instead of south to begin its second approach. The aircraft flew into a near vertical mountain wall at 240 knots. In the final seconds, the captain assessed the Ground Proximity Warning System warning as false. The accident was caused by a combination of occurrences, errors and actions by both the crew and ATC. The initial problem with the flaps, the lack of radar service, a misread chart by the crew, communication difficulties and the use of non-standard phraseology among other items led to the accident. The aircraft failed to gain altitude after lift-off, touched down again and overran the runway bursting into flames 2,000 feet past the runway. Possible engine failure. Crashed into a lake in the Chacaltaya mountains during poor weather conditions. The aircraft was on a test flight after replacement of all primary flight control cables.

While en route, the aircraft cashed into trees and burst into flames. Struck a mountain. The pilot inadequately evaluating the en route weather conditions, and the pilot making the in-flight decision to continue VFR flight into adverse weather conditions. Factors in this accident were the inability of the pilot to see and avoid the mountainous terrain due to the thunderstorms. The cargo plane crashed into the AtlantiOcean while en route. Crashed short of the runway after attempting an emergency return to the airport after takeoff. Engine failure. Crashed into power lines at 40m during an approach to land. The aircraft attempted to ditch into a canal after two engines failed on takeoff. After a third engine failed, the aircraft crashed into a marsh. Fuel contamination. Shortly after taking off from Schiphol Airport, while climbing through 6,500 feet, the No. 3 engine separated with its pylon from the aircraft and damaged the leading edge of the right wing. The No. 3 engine separated in such a way that the No. 4 engine and pylon also separated from the wing. During an attempted return to the airport, the aircraft crashed into a 11 story building in the Bijlmermeer residential district. The design and certification of the B-747 pylon was found to be inadequate to provide the required level of safety. The system to ensure structural integrity by inspection failed. The separation of the No. 3 engine was initiated by fatigue (corrosion) in the inboard midspar fuse pin. This led to loss of the No. 4 engine and pylon and damage to several systems which ultimately led to loss of control of the aircraft. Struck power lines and crashed.

The aircraft flew into high ground at 8,800 ft. while positioning for an approach to Goma.The accident happened in darkness. While attempting a second landing in high winds, during a storm, the aircraft's wing tip hit the runway resulting in the aircraft departing the runway and causing a fuel tank to explode. The high rate of descent in the final phase of the approach and the landing made on the right landing gear which exceeded the structural limitations of the aircraft.The crosswind, which exceeded the aircrafts limits and which occurred in the final phase of the approach and during landing. The combination of both factors caused stresses which exceeded the structural limitations of the aircraft. Midair collision with an Libyan Air Force fighter at 3,500 ft. The pilot was transporting personnel within a remote mountain valley in support of the commercial filming of celebrity skiers. The skiers had been filmed as they skied down a ridge, and were being flown back to the top of the ridge line. During the third go-around following three attempts to land on the ridge top landing site, the helicopter disappeared into a cloud bank and impacted the ridge at the 8,500-ft level. The pilot's continuation of VFR flight into instrument meteorological conditions, and his decision to continue his landing attempts under the adverse weather conditions.

The accident occurred during daylight and in heavy rain. The aircraft shuttered violently after takeoff,  rolled to the left, then right and crashed. Icing. Loss of roll controllability due to contamination on the wings with ice. Failure to de-ice the plane before taking off. The airplane was in cruise flight along an airway, with a minimum en route altitude of 13,300 feet, when it impacted terrain at an elevation of 10,600 feet. The pilot's inadequate preflight planning/preparation and the selection of an altitude that would not provide terrain clearance along his planned route. Factors were the dark night conditions and the mountainous terrain. Crashed 5 km short and 1km to the right of Runway 26 in poor weather conditons The aircraft crashed approximately 30 minutes after takeoff in rain. The No.2 engine and pylon separated from the aircraft at 2,000 feet. The plane landed safely. The engine separation was due to an encounter with severe or possibly extreme turbulence and a fatigue crack.

Crashed into the sea after departing Caracas on a test flight. The slats were inadvertently deployed while at FL 330. The aircraft progressed through several pitch oscillations and lost 5,000 feet in altitude. Inadequate design of the flap/slat actuation handle that allowed the handle to be easily and inadvertently dislodged from the UP/RET position, thereby causing extension of the leading edge slats during cruise flight. While cruising at FL240, a fracture of the propeller hub resulted in the separation of a propeller blade and damage to the engine, nacelle, wing and fuselage causing significant degradation to aircraft performance. The aircraft was incapable of maintaining altitude and crashed into a silo while attempting to make an emergency landing. South Dakota Governor George Mickelson, 52, killed. Flew into hillside in poor weather conditions. During take off, the aircraft failed to climb and struck a vehicle on a publiroad just beyond the end of the runway. The aircraft was substantially damaged and the pilot elected to carry out a forced landing. During the attempted landing, the aircraft struck powerlines, crashed and burned. Crashed into a hill in poor visibility, low clouds and fog. Crashed into the sea after taking off from Libreville Airport. An engine fire led to loss of control of the aircraft.  All eighteen members of the Zambian national soccer team killed. The deliberate disregard for Federal Aviation Regulations, GP Express procedures, and prudent concern for safety by the two pilots in their decision to execute an aerobatimanoeuvre during a scheduled check ride flight, and the failure of GP Express management to establish and maintain a commitment to instill professionalism in their pilots consistent with the highest levels of safety necessary for an airline operating scheduled passenger service. While landing, undershot the runway and struck a vehicle. The plane hit Mt. Paramo Frontino at 12,300 ft. while on approach to Maria Cordova Airport. Errors by the crew and the ATC. The aircraft descended into mountainous terrain before actually reaching the Abejorral NDB beacon. The VOR/DME had been sabotaged by terrorists and not in service. The cargo plane impacted a hill while on visual approach to El Yopal. Lost the right engine on takeoff. The pilot returned to the airport and landed with the landing gear retracted. During the slide the left wing struck a rock and ruptured causing the plane to burst into flames. On final approach at low speed the left wing dropped and touched the ground during a stall or deliberate low left turn. The plane cartwheeled and broke up. The cargo aboard shifted after takeoff, the plane nosed up, stalled and crashed. The crew reported they were diverting due to thunderstorms. Soon after the aircraft crashed after encountering severe turbulence. The plane overran the runway while attempting to land in rain and reduced visibility and crashed onto a beach. Shot down by Abkhazi forces. The pilot told the local controller that the baggage door was open and he requested a 'go around.' the local controller told the pilot to make right traffic. Multiple witnesses saw the airplane in a nose high attitude during the initial climb after takeoff. They reported the pilot entered a right turn which continued until the airplane 'fell to the ground and hit nose first.  The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed while maneuvering in the traffipattern. A factor which contributed to the accident was the pilot's failure to assure that the nose baggage compartment door was secured. The helicopter crashed while attempting to land in a confined area of the infield of the Talladega Super Speedway. The pilot of the helicopter, NASCAR race car driver Davey Allison, 30, killed. The pilot's poor in-flight decision to land downwind in a confined area that was surrounded by high obstructions, and his failure to properly compensate for the tailwind condition. The aircraft crashed into a lake after it was unable to get airborne while attempting to takeoff. Mechanical failure. Flaps selected but did not extend. The aircraft hit Mt. Ungeo at 800 ft. while on approach after two missed landing attempts in high winds and heavy rain. Captain's decision to land in weather that had fallen below minima. The aircraft ran low of fuel while en route and crashed during the subsequent attempted forced landing on open ground in the jungle. The aircraft strayed off course after encountering poor weather conditions. The aircraft flew into a hillside during a visual approach to Bharatpur. The accident happened in daylight and good weather, however,  the mountains were shrouded in clouds. The pilot's failure to adequately evaluate inflight weather conditions which resulted in a loss of control when the airplane encountered a thunderstorm. The plane crashed 1/4 of a mile short of the runway, while on approach. Impaired judgment, decision making and flying abilities of the captain and flight crew due to the effects of fatigue. A sudden pitch-up during approach led the crew to go-around.  The pitch-up continued until the plane stalled and crashed.  Improperly loaded baggage shifted the center of gravity beyond the acceptable limit. While taking off, the aircraft, overloaded by 3 times the number of people the plane was designed for, never got airborne, overran the runway and crashed into the Pyanj river. The crew was coerced into taking off by armed men who commandeered the plane. The aircraft skidded off  the end of the runway while landing. The crew was made aware of windshear at approach end of runway but not of poor water drainage on the runway nor a change in wind direction. A very light touch of the runway surface with the landing gear and lack of compression of the left landing gear leg to the extent understood by the aircraft computer as the actual landing, resulted in delayed deployment of spoilers and thrust reversers. The delay was about 9 seconds. Thus, the braking commenced with delay and in a condition of heavy rain and strong tailwind the aircraft did not stop on the runway. The aircraft was named Kulbach. Crashed into the sea. Shot down with a missile by Abkhazi separatist rebels. The aircraft was hit by a missile then crash landed on the runway. Terrorist act  by Abkhazian rebels. While on the ground, the aircraft struck by artillery fire from Abkhazian rebels, killing one crew member. The plane was on a seniflight of the Mt. Cook area and impacted Franz Josef Glacier at 4,500 ft. The aircraft became trapped in a narrow valley and as the pilot attempted to turn around within the valley the aircraft stalled while it was in a steep bank. While landing during a rainstorm, the aircraft went off the end of the runway, into a swamp, collapsing the landing gear and breaking the fuselage into three sections. The aircraft descended below minima during a localizer approach, without a glideslope, struck the top of trees and crashed into a swamp in heavy rain showers and strong winds. One witness, located about two miles south of the airport, saw the airplane turn sharply left, drop nose low, recover, drop nose low, and then descend from sight behind trees. Investigators and rescue personnel discovered a large amount of ice debris along the flight path and outside the fire ring at the crash site. An inadvertent stall by the pilot in command. Factors associated with the accident are the icing conditions and low ceilings. The aircraft took off and made a low right turn, struck trees and crashed. The crew most likely lost situational awareness and as a result did not detect the increasing deviation from their intended flight path. Contributing factor was the loss of AC power to some of the flight instruments the reason for which could not be determined. The plane crashed short of the runway while landing in dense fog, hitting power lines and a wall. The autopilot disconnected during approach and re-engaged with the vertical speed mode at 800ft/min. Crashed while in a holding pattern and after running out of fuel. The crew did not follow a standard holding pattern. The airliner crashed and exploded after an aborted landing at Ohrid Airport. The aircraft was diverted to Ohrid because of bad weather. Violation of airport traffipattern. The flight had earlier carried out a missed approach but the crew had reportedly failed to follow the normal procedure and as a result lost situational awareness. Crashed into a  mountain, 30km from Guatemala City at 10,500 ft. While on approach, the aircraft collided with trees and terrain 3 miles from the runway threshold in fog and freezing drizzle. Delay by the captain to start the descent which led to a breakdown in crew coordination and the loss of altitude awareness by the flightcrew during an unstabilized approach in night instrument meteorological conditions. Four minutes after taking off the pilot reported he was having engine problems and was returning. The aircraft subsequently crashed onto a frozen lake, 7.7nm from the airfield in darkness. Midair collision. The Twin Otter, which was descending inbound to Dakar, collided with a Gambia Airways aircraft which had just taken off. The Twin Otter crashed into the sea. Failure to maintain assigned altitude. Three killed aboard the Twin Otter. The YS-11 was able to land safely. Crashed on approach to Phongsavanh Airport after striking trees in heavy fog.

The aircraft followed in a Boeing 757 for landing, became caught in its wake turbulence, rolled into a deep descent and crashed. Rich Snyder, president of In-N-Out Burger chain killed. The aircraft stalled and crashed in fog when the tail struck the runway as the pilot attempted a go-around as it landed at Gyumri. The plane crashed during takeoff following a fire in the No. 2 engine and subsequent loss of the two remaining engines. Faulty air starter unit. Crew took off ignoring the 'starter warning light' thinking it was false.  The crew underestimated the severity of the situation due to shortcomings in the operational documentation.  Breakup of the No.2 engine starter, damaging fuel and oil lines and causing a fire. Crashed at sea 42 minutes after departing.  The pilot reported mechanical problems before contact was lost with the plane. The pilot indicated he had engine trouble and was attempting to land at Okeechobee. When he could not find the airport, he attempted to land on a dirt road. Upon observing a car on the road he aborted the landing rolled to the right and crashed into trees. Improper remedial action concerning a right engine power anomaly and the failure to maintain adequate airspeed during a go-around from a precautionary landing. Failure of the right engine fuel control bearing. The aircraft stalled 1.2 miles east of runway 28L during an ILS approach. An aerodynamistall occurred when the flightcrew allowed the airspeed to decay to stall speed following a poorly planned and executed approach characterized by an absence of procedural discipline. Improper pilot response to the stall warning including failure to advance the power levers to maximum and inappropriately raising the flaps. Flightcrew's inexperience in a  'glass cockpit' automated aircraft. The cargo plane ran out of fuel and crashed. While on approach the nose pitched up, the aircraft stalled and crashed short of the runway. Icing of the horizontal stabilizer. The plane struck Cerro Carpich at 4,000 ft., 6 minutes after leaving the airport at Tingo Maria. The cargo plane struck trees and high terrain after losing three engines during severe icing. Multiple engine failures occurred as a result of flight in extreme icing conditions. Incomplete performance of the emergency drills by the crew, as a result of not referring to the Emergency Checklist, prejudiced the chances of successful engine re-starts. Crew actions for securing and re-starting the failed engines, which were not in accordance with the operator's procedures, limited the power available. The drag from two unfeathered propellers of the failed engines and the weight of the heavily iced airframe resulted in a loss of height and control before the chosen diversion airfield could be reached. Poor Crew Resource Management reduced the potential for emergency planning, decision making and workload sharing. Consequently, the crew had no contingency plan for the avoidance of the forecast severe icing conditions, and also was unaware of the relative position of a closer diversion airfield which could have been chosen by making more effective use of air traffiservices. The aircraft overran the runway and came to rest at the edge of the east river, after an aborted takeoff. Failure to turn on the pilot/statiheat system resulting in erroneous air speed indication. Though heavily damaged, the plane was repaired and put back into service. Crashed during touch-and-go exercises. Application of wrong rudder by trainee pilot  during engine failure exercise. Captain did not guard/block the rudder control and give clear commands as instructor so as to obviate the application of wrong rudder control by the trainee pilot. Crashed while attempting to land at Tamworth. Crashed into sea after a shell exploded in one of the gun barrells. Shot down with a missile by Armenian forces while en route. The cargo plane lost a right engine during takeoff. The plane tried to return to the airport but crashed. The failure of the pilot-in-command to maintain airspeed. Factors to the accident were: cylinder fatigue, dark night and stall encountered. After discharging passengers the sea plane took off, the nose pitched up and crashed. Failure of the pilot-in-command to assure the bilges were adequately pumped free of water, which resulted in the aft center of gravity limit to be exceeded, and failure of the aircrew to follow the checklist. A factor related to the accident was the water leak. Lost an engine while taking off and then lost a second engine and crashed 1,300 ft. beyond the runway. The plane crashed during an approach to Bogota. The helicopter crashed into The Mountain of the Stone Slab at an elevation of 800 ft. Pilot error in proceeding towards high ground in heavy fog below a safe altitude. The aircraft crashed after a captain allowed his child to manipulate the controls of the plane. The pilot's 11 year old daughter and 16 year old son were taking turns in the pilot's seat. While the boy was flying, he inadvertently disengaged the autopilot linkage to the ailerons and put the airliner in a bank of 90 degrees which caused the nose to drop sharply. The co-pilot pulled back on the yoke to obtain level flight but the plane stalled. With his seat pulled all the way back, the co-pilot in the right hand seat could not properly control the aircraft. After several stalls and rapid pull-ups the plane went into a spiral descent. In the end the co-pilot initiated a 4.8g pull-up and nearly regained a stable flight path but the aircraft struck the ground in an almost level attitude killing all aboard. The aircraft was named Glinka, after Mikhail Glinka, the father of Russian music. The jet fighter collided in mid air with the transport as they approached Pope Air Force Base. The fighter then slid into a staging area where troops were boarding a third aircraft (66-0173). The two  fighter jet pilots parachuted to safety and the crew of five of 68-10942 were not injured but 23 on the ground were killed.  Confusing instructions given to the F-16 by a civilian tower controller at Fayetteville. The helicopter crashed shortly after takeoff. The ingestion of foreign material (snow) in the engine, which resulted in a flameout (loss of engine power). Factors related to the accident were: the adverse weather conditions (snow falling & high density altitude), the lack of snow covers to protect the engine intakes while parked and awaiting for the weather conditions to improve, improper planning/decision by the pilot and the company/operator management, inadequate information in the flight manual, and the lack of suitable terrain for an emergency landing. Shortly after taking off, the plane experienced engine problems and returned to the airport. While attempting to land the aircraft rolled to the right, pitched up, stalled and cashed. Inadequate use of the flight controls during an asymmetrigo-around resulting in loss of control. Contributing factors were insufficient understanding of the flightcrew of the SAAB 340B engine oil system, lack of awareness of the consequences of an aircraft configuration with one engine in flight idle and poor crew resource management. Struck Mt. Lozan, at 13,400 ft. which was obscured by clouds 47 minutes after taking off. Shot down by a missile. President of Burundi, Cyprien Ntaryamira and president of Rwanda, Juvenal Habyarimana were killed. Shot down by friendly fire during the Gulf War. Thirteen killed on each helicopter. Crashed into Mt. Saran 30 minutes before it was scheduled to land in poor weather condtions. While on ILS approach to Nagoya Airport, at an altitude of 1,000 feet, the first officer inadvertently triggered the TOGA (take-off-go-around) lever. The crew tried to override this situation by turning off the autothrottle and reducing air speed. The aircraft stalled, hit the runway tail first and burst into flames. The plane crashed because of an extreme out of trim configuration brought about by the fact that the tailplane setting had moved automatically and undetected to a maximum nose-up position. The plane climbed at a steep angle until it stalled. The crew could have saved the aircraft even in the final seconds had they reverted to basiflight procedures and switched off the autopilot. Landed in fog, overrunning the runway and crashing into a blast fence. The failure of the captain to use the available ILS glideslope, his failure to execute a go-around when conditions were not suitable for landing, and his failure to land the airplane at a point sufficient to allow for a safe stopping distance; the fatalities were caused by the presence of the nonfrangible blast fence and the absence of a safety area at the end of the runway Crashed into a mountain while inbound for Bogota. The aircraft was destroyed when it undershot the runway during a visual approach to Sao Gabriel and stuck trees. Crashed while making an emergency landing following engine trouble. Crashed shortly after taking off after double engine failure. Continued VFR flight into IMC. The plane broke-up in flight 10 minutes after taking off. Auto-pilot induced oscillations caused the aircraft to shake violently. The autopilot yaw-channel was accidentally connected to the bank control and the bank-channel to the yaw controls. The aircraft flew into high ground during a go-around. The accident happened in darkness and in poor weather with rain and heavy clouds. The accident was attributed to the pilot's failure to follow the established go-around procedure correctly. The aircraft crashed in poor weather conditions 0.8 nm south of the threshold of runway 1R at Dulles International Airport while attempting a ILS landing. Poor airmanship and relative inexperience of the captain in initiating and continuing an unstabilized instrument approach that led to a descent below the authorized altitude without visual contact with the runway environment. Contributing to the cause of the accident was the lack of a GPWS on the airplane. The aircraft struck Mt. Kalora at 2,300 feet while on a visual approach to Palu. The accident happened in generally good weather but with reduced visibility in clouds and haze at the mountain. The float plane hit the surface of glassy water and crashed. VFR flight into IMC. Failure to maintain altitude above the river. Crashed on approach 3 miles short of the runway into a wooded area. Shot down by Afghan troops. The plane crashed after demonstrating a simulated engine failure on takeoff. Caused by a number of factors relating to the test and actions of the crew none of which singley would have caused the crash. Unexpected mode transition to altitude acquire mode during a simulated  engine failure resulted in excessive pitch, loss of airspeed, and loss of control. Pitch attitude protection not provided in altitude acquire mode. The plane crash landed on the runway in adverse weather, after a second landing attempt, breaking the landing gear and sliding off the side of the runway. The aircraft crashed into trees and a private residence after a  missed approach during adverse weather conditions. Microburst induced windshear. Crew's inability to recognize windshear and microburst conditions.  The flightcrew's decision to continue an approach into severe convective activity that was conducive to a microburst. The flightcrew's failure to recognize a windshear situation in a timely manner. The flightcrew's failure to establish and maintain the proper airplane attitude and thrust setting necessary to escape the windshear. The lack of real-time adverse weather and windshear hazard information dissemination from air trafficontrol. The aircraft lifted off slowly. After lift-off, the plane settled in a descenting left turn and crashed. Excess gross weight and incorrect CG caused the plane to stall. The helicopter crashed into the water. All survived but were not equipped with life vests and 3 passengers drowned. Failure of the engine-driven fuel pump, which resulted in the loss of power, and the lack of aircraft flotation equipment. Factors related to the accident were: flight over water adjacent to terrain that afforded no suitable forced landing site, and the lack of a passenger briefing by the operator on the location and operation of life preservers Crashed into high ground while on approach to land. Ran off the end of the runway and crashed. The crew used the normal and emergency brake systems at the same time which resulted in the aircraft having no brakes at all. Crashed on a wooded hillside shortly after taking off from Colon after a bomb exploded aboard. Crashed 5 minutes after taking off from Kilo Lima. Crashed and burned while attempting to land with an engine fire in poor visibility and heavy rain. The aircraft overran the runway and caught fire while landing during adverse weather conditions.  The approach was flown with slats/flaps at 15/20 degrees due to suspected windshear. Crew error. There was a struggle and argument between the captain and co-pilot during the last seconds of the landing as to whether they should go-around. The pilot flew into a blind box canyon and crashed while attempting to turn around. Improper in-flight planning /decision by the pilot and his failure to remain clear of mountainous terrain. The box canyon and proximity of mountains were related factors. The non-instrument rated commercial pilot was en route at 2000 feet msl on a night VFR flight when he reported an inadvertent encounter with instrument meteorological conditions. The helicopter (N124NH) subsequently crashed in a wooded area while in a steep descent. Continued VFR flight into IMC. Suffered engine failure and made a crash landing on terrain near the shoreline of a body of water. Fatigue cracking of the engine case, which resulted in eventual damage to the #3 cylinder studs/engine through-bolts, subsequent separation of the #3 cylinder and piston, and an in-flight fire. Inadequate maintenance and inspection. The aircraft entered a steep dive from 16,000 ft. and crashed 10 minutes after taking off from Agadir. The pilot was blamed for disconnecting the autopilot and deliberately causing the crash and committing suicide. This was challenged by the Moroccan Pilot's Union. While on approach, the aircraft went into a sudden nose dive from 6,000 ft. and crashed into a wooded ravine 6 miles northwest of Pittsburgh International Airport. The accident was caused by a loss of control of the aircraft resulting from the movement of the rudder surface to its blowdown limit or an uncommanded rudder reversal. The rudder surface deflected in a direction opposite to that commanded by the pilots as a result of a jam of the main rudder PCU servo valve secondary slide to the servo valve housing offset from its neutral position and overtravel of the  primary slide. The most likely sequence of events that led up to the accident included the jamming of the PCU servo valve, the application of light left rudder followed by hard right rudder which caused the rudder to reverse in the opposite direction the pilot commanded it to go.  The application of hard right rudder was possibly initiated because the plane flew into the wake vortex of a B-727 which rolled the plane to the left.  Rudder hardover is normally corrected with the stick (ailerons) but because the plane was flying at the crossover speed of 190 knots with flaps 1, using the stick would not correct the situation. When the right rudder was applied the rudder went to its fullblown left position causing the plane to roll further left, stall and go into a dive. Some speculate if the pilot-in-command pushed forward on the yoke to gain some speed rather than pull back, the accident possibly could have been avoided. Blame was not placed on the crew because there was no mention of this type of recovery by the manufacturer nor was there any training for such an occurrence. The aircraft few into the side of a hill during heavy rain, high winds and severe turbulence. Just as the plane took off there was a pitch-up and stall resulting in the plane crashing into the water. The down elevator control cable failed at station 367 due to corrosion. The failure resulted from salt water induced corrosion. The aircraft had recently undergone a periodiinspection but the damage had apparently not been discovered.

Overweight and improperly loaded. The aircraft suddenly pitched down and crashed while on approach. Icing. The aircraft was in a holding pattern and was descending to a newly assigned altitude of 8,000 feet when it experienced an uncommanded roll and excursion and crashed during a rapid descent. Icing. The design of the rubber de-icing boot was insufficient to deal with icing on the wings. Sudden and unexpected aileron hinge movement reversal, that occurred after a ridge of ice accreted beyond the deice boots while the airplane was in a holding pattern during which it intermittently encountered supercooled cloud and drizzle/rain drops, the size and water content of which exceeded those described in the icing certificication envelope. The airplane was susceptible to this loss of control and the crew was unable to recover. Contributing factor was the French Directorate General for Civil Aviation's inadequate oversight of the ATR42 and ATR 72, and its failure to take the necessary corrective action to ensure continued airworthiness in icing conditions and failure to provide the FAA with timely airworthiness information developed from previous ATR incidents and accidents in icing conditions. Crashed into the sea off of Cozumel while en route in poor weather condtions.  Fuel exhaustion. The cargo plane crashed into a mountain a 4,000 ft. The pilot delayed landing to avoid a pedestrian on the runway, overran the runway and crashed into Saposoa River breaking up. While en route, the cargo plane made an uncontrolled descent and crashed. Loss of aircraft control at night by the pilot for unknown reasons. Crashed into a mountain in poor weather conditions.

VFR flight by the pilot into instrument meteorological conditions (imc), and his failure to maintain sufficient altitude or clearance from mountainous terrain. The aircraft crashed 4 miles SW of runway 5L while on an ILS approach. The captain associated the illumination of the left engine ignition light with an engine failure, suspected an engine flame out and decided to execute a missed approach. This eventually led to a stall and the plane crashed 4 miles SW of the runway threshold. The captain's improper assumption that an engine had failed. The captain's subsequent failure to follow approved procedures for engine failure, single-engine approach, go-around, and stall recovery. Contributing to the cause of the accident was the failure of American Eagle management to identify, document, monitor and remedy deficiencies in pilot performance and training. The cargo plane hit trees and crashed short of the runway while attempting to land. The chartered flight struck a cliff at 6,400 ft. during a flight from a copper and gold mine.

Her mother threw her out of the plane and she landed in some soft-water lilies. Possible electrical fire. Possible faulty altimeter. The cargo plane was observed in a shallow left bank until it descended and struck trees and broke up. The pilot's failure to properly configure the aircraft fuel system prior to takeoff and his failure maintain an adequate terrain clearance altitude while maneuvering to return to the airport. Factors in the accident were the dark night lighting conditions, low ceilings, restricted visibility conditions, and the pilot's diverted attention which resulted from activation of the airplane's fuel selector warning horn system. The cargo plane crashed while on approach. Failure of the pilot-in-command to maintain visual contact with terrain and sufficient altitude for terrain clearance. Factors in the accident were the pilot's decision to initiate a descent 14 miles from the airport, and weather, specifically cloud conditions and darkness. Departed Sequin inVFR conditons towards a cloud bank, at night, turning south towards upsloping terrain. Pilot reported turbulence and structural problem before crashing. VFR flight into IMC. Took off and crashed into power lines in rain and fog. Continued VFR flight into IMC. The  captain decided to aborted the take-off. However, the aircraft was never brought to a stop and it continued  on overrunning the runway and crashing down a steep slope. Failure of the crew to follow the correct procedure to continue with the rejection of the take-off once that action had been initiated. Lack of crew coordination, insufficient emphasis on emergency training, inadequate enforcement of the requirements of the operations manual and a lack of supervision during loading preparation. While taking off the aircraft veered to the right and clipped some trees 2,000 ft. past the runway. Overloaded and possible fuel contamination. The plane flew into a flock of birds that were injested into the left engine.  The pilot soon after reported an engine fire and that he was returning to the airport.  However, control of the plane was lost and the aircraft crashed. Crashed while en route on a positioning flight. Crashed after taking off and the pilot declaring an emergency. A loss of power on one engine for  undetermined reasons, and the pilot's improper decision to return to the departure airport for landing which neccessitated maneuvering over increasingly higher terrain. Factors in the accident were: the high gusting wind, the high density altitude, the rising terrain, and the reduced single-engine performance capability of the airplane under these conditions. On a positioning flight the crew aborted its first takeoff. On the second takeoff the tail struck the ground and crashed back to the ground. The loss of directional control by the pilot in command during the takeoff roll, and his decision to continue the takeoff and initiate a rotation below the computed rotation airspeed, resulting in a premature lift-off, further loss of control and collision with the terrain. The flight crew's lack of understanding of the three-engine takeoff procedures, and their decision to modify those procedures. The failure of the company to ensure that the flight crew had adequate experience, training, and rest to conduct the nonroutine flight. Contributing to the accident was the inadequacy of Federal Aviation Administration oversight of Air Transport International and Federal Aviation Administration flight and duty time regulations that permitted a substantially reduced flight crew rest period when conducting a nonrevenue ferry flight under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The cargo plane flew into high ground while on approach in poor weather conditons. The cargo plane crashed into a mountain while on approach. The pilot's failure to comply with published instrument approach procedures by a premature descent below the minimum altitude specified for the approach. Crashed into trees in a residential neighborhood after experiencing an engine failure while taking off.. Shortly after takeoff in poor visibility and heavy snow, with autothrottles engaged, climb thrust was selected. The right engine throttle jammed and remained at takeoff thrust, while the left engine throttle slowly reduced to idle. The increasing thrust asymmetry resulted in an increasing left bank angle, which eventually reached about 170 degrees. The airplane lost altitude and impacted the ground. Lack of crew response to an extreme nose-down attitude. The investigation concluded that the captain was incapacitated. Just before impact the first officer expressed his concern about the situation of either the captain's incapacitation or the aircraft's attitude and attempted a recovery.

The SA-227 collided with the Piper PA-31-350 that was taking off while approaching Sioux Lookout. Neither flight crew saw the other aircraft in time to avoid the collision. The Piper crashed into a  wooded area and the Swearing into Lake Seul. Contributing to the occurrence were the inherent limitations of the see-and-avoid concept which preclude the effective separation of aircraft with high closure rates, the fact that neither crew was directly alerted to the presence of the other aircraft by the Flight Service specialist or by onboard electroniequipment and an apparent lack of pilot understanding of how to optimize avoidance maneuvering. Crashed into Cerro Sincholagua mountain at 16,000 ft.  during an approach to Quito. Pilot fatigue may have been a factor. Crashed into a mountain during approach in poor weather. An engine caught fire shortly after takeoff and the aircraft was not able to make an emergency landing and crashed. The crew had serious problems maintaining their heading after both artificial horizons failed shortly after takeoff. The crew had difficulty controlling the aircraft in turbulent conditions and the plane went into a spiral dive and crashed into a field. One or possibly both of the aircraft's artificial horizons malfunctioned and in the absence of a standby horizon, for which there was no airworthiness requirement, there was no single instrument available for assured attitude reference or simple means of determining which flight instruments had failed. The pilot became spatially disoriented and was unable to maintain control. Ditched in the sea just offshore, after losing an engine on approach. The pilot was not rated for that aircraft type and had very little experience. The right engine disintegrated and caught fire during takeoff. The takeoff was aborted. Engine parts penetrated cabin and caused  a cabin fire and seriously injured a flight attendant. Fatigue in a compressor disc. Failure of maintenance personnel to properly inspect the engine part during overhaul. As the plane approached  Runway 25,  the right main landing gear did not extend. While the captain continued the descent the co-pilot carried out the landing gear alternate extension checklist. The plane descended below the minimum safe step-down altitudes for the approach and struck the top of a ridge line. The captain did not ensure the aircraft intercepted and maintained the approach profile during the non-precision instrument approach. The captain's  unwise decision to get the landing gear lowered without discontinuing the instrument approach. The captain's distraction from the primary task of flying the aircraft safely during the first officer's attempt  to correct a landing gear malfunction. Crashed in poor weather condtions. Flying VOR the plane ran into poor weather and the pilot decided to return however crashed into trees while attempting to land. The aircraft, carrying members of a local soccer club crashed 10 miles short of it's destination. Adverse weather conditions and overloaded. Crashed while landing in heavy rain.

Chichontepevolcano at 5,900 ft. at night during heavy rain and thunderstorms. Possible damage to the aircraft's DME due to lightning. Confusion between the pilot and ATC due to bad weather and a diversion. The Ground Proximity Warning System had sounded and power was applied but too late. Crashed into Mt. Komawa at 9,200 ft. in poor weather. Found 8/14/95. Crashed into Nevado de Huila at an elevation of 14,500 feet. Shortly after taking off from Atlanta on a flight to Gulfport, the aircraft experienced propeller separation in the left engine while climbing through FL 180. The aircraft hit trees, crashed into a field and burned while trying to make an emergency landing at West Georgia Regional Airport. The in-flight fatigue fracture and separation of a propeller blade resulting in distortion of the left engine nacelle, causing excessive drag, loss of wing lift, and reduced directional control of the airplane. The fracture was caused by a fatigue crack from multiple corrosion pits that were not discovered by Hamilton Standard because of inadequate and ineffective corporate inspection and repair techniques, training, documentation and communication. Two died of their injuries after the accident. While en route the cargo plane flew into a 4,800 ft. mountain. The pilot's continued VFR flight into instrument meteorological conditions. The weather was a factor. During a low flying turn manuve, at an air show, the pilot caused the plane to stall and crash into the water. The captain made an error of judgement in modifying one of the display manoeuvres to the extent that he stalled the aircraft at a height and attitude from which recovery was impossible. After climbing to 18,400' msl, the pilot reported a turbocharger problem & reversed course. He said he 'may lose the left engine' & that he was unable to maintain altitude. He diverted to an alternate airport. During a right turn onto final approach, the airplane was observed to cross (overshoot) the extended centerline of the runway. It continued in a right turn back toward the centerline, and then entered a left turn to intercept the inbound course. The turn steepened, and then the airplane entered a spin & crashed 1/2 mile short of the runway. Failure of the pilot to maintain adequate airspeed, while maneuvering on approach, which resulted in an inadvertent stall/spin and uncontrolled collision with terrain. Factors relating to the accident were: the pilot allowed the aircraft weight and balance limitations to be exceeded; the pilot's lack of recurrent training in the make and model of airplane; inadequate maintenance/inspection of the engine exhaust systems; a warped and leaking exhaust system flange on the left engine, which resulted in a loss of power in that engine; and the pilot's improper use of the flaps. Crashed short of the runway in rain, fog and reduced visibility after diverting from another airport and two landing attempts. Crashed after running out of fuel. The pilot reported an instrument problem after taking off from Ratmalana Airport and was returning for an emergency landing when the plane fell from 8,000 feet and crashed into the sea. The intended destination was Mores Cay, but one of the survivors stated the pilot could not find the island and diverted to Marsh Harbour. Following a visual approach, the aircraft landed long and fast and overran the end of the runway into a shanty town while attempting a go-around. Struck a tree and crashed while attempting to land. The control inputs of the co-pilot; and the period the landing gear remained extended after the simulated engine failure. The plane crashed into mountains after a premature descent. The aircraft suffered multiple bird strikes in the No. 1 and 2 engines just after taking off when it flew into a flock of 100 or more Canada Geese. The crew initiated a slow climb and began to dump fuel. The aircraft attained a maximum altitude of 250 ft. before it started to descend. The plane impacted a hilly wooded area less than a mile from the runway, broke up, exploded and burned.  Ingestion of Canada geese into the Nos.1 and 2 engines. Lack of adequate procedures to reduce bird hazards. The crew was not warned about observations of birds in the area by the ATC. Crashed through the ice while attempting to land and sank in shallow water. The weather conditions were below minima and the helicopter exceeded its maximum takeoff weight. While on an intercept heading for the final approach and in straight-and-level flight, the aircraft crashed into the side of a 1,047 ft, mountain in heavy fog. The pilot progressively lost situational awareness while attempting to navigate in conditions of low visibility or in cloud and was unaware of the rapidly rising terrain in his flight path. Thirty minutes into the flight the aircraft was not able to maintain altitude after oil pressure was lost in the No. 1 engine. Crashed into trees. Crashed into mountains at Barskoon Pass while en route. While looking for elk, the aircraft struck trees and crashed.

Strong winds and thunderstorms were in the area at the time. While attempting to land the cargo plane struck light posts and crashed into a field. The plane went into a dive and crashed 6 km short of the runway into a swamp during a second attempt at landing. Loss of power in the No. 1 engine. The aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff while attempting to make an emergency landing after the pilot reported problems with the left engine. Vibration caused nuts to work loose from the engine turbine which resulted in engine failure. No fault was found with the right engine and it is believed that it may have been inadvertently shut down by the crew. The aircraft crashed into mountainous terrain while en route. Crew error. Fuel-feed selected from wing tanks on one side only, causing an imbalance and banking to the right. The autopilot was able to counteract the imbalance for approximately 35 minutes into the flight. Deviated off course and struck a mountain at 5,000 ft. The plane was flying illegal Haitian immigrants back from Cayenne. The plane crashed and burned shortly after takeoff after reaching a height of 500 ft. Combination of overloading and icing.

While on a flight from Miami, FL to Cali, Columbia the aircraft crashed into Mt. El Deluvio 38 miles north of Cali while attempting to land. On approach, the crew was requested to report over Tulua VOR which they already passed. This confused them and they decided to go direct to Rozo beacon. Entering the abbreviation 'R', incorrectly steered the plane towards Bogota. More than a minute into the  turn the crew steered manually toward Cali, but this now took them into the path of a mountain. Crew error. Lack of situational awareness, failure to adequately plan and execute the approach, failure to realize that the FMS had turned the aircraft toward mountains. Crew also neglected to retract the speed brakes after the Ground Proximity Warning System alert.  Lack of adequate radar. Different  Flight Management System naming convention from that published in navigational charts. Diverted from Madang to Bagasin, overran the runway and crashed. Crashed into the sea while approaching an oil rig to land in strong winds. The aircraft failed to gain altitude after taking off from N'Dolo Airport and ran off the runway and crashed into a market square. The plane was overloaded by 595 lbs. The aircraft certification was revoked and crew did not have authorization to fly. The number killed on the ground varies widely from different sources. The number of fatalities, 225, is derived from the publication Weekly Mail and Guardian in an article covering the court trial of the pilots, charging them with the deaths of 225 people. Some sources quote as many as 350 died. After losing an engine the plane began to lose altitude and ditched in the AtlantiOcean 30 km southwest of Bridgetown.

Descent  by the pilot into a cloud layer at high speed with insufficient forward visibility. Descent under a cloud layer; misidentification of terrain features; loss of 'positional awareness'; insufficient forward visibility; the high speed of the aircraft; and the pilot's decision making. The No. 1 engine failed or power was reduced after takeoff followed by loss of the second engine. With the gear down and flaps extended,  the crew lost control of the aircraft and crashed 1.2 miles past the runway into a soccer field killing 24 on the ground. The cargo plane was unable to gain altitude while attempting to takeoff, overran the runway and hit power lines and a conrete barrier. Inadequate pre-flight planning and preparation by the PIC, his failure to ensure the aircraft was properly loaded within limitations, his failure to use proper flaps for takeoff, his failure to use ADI (Antidetonation Injection) assisted takeoff, and his resultant failure to attain sufficient airspeed to climb after takeoff. Factors relating to the accident were: the high density altitude, and the PIC's lack of experience in the make and model of airplane. The plane crashed into the AtlantiOcean, 21 km north of Puerto Plata, shortly after taking off. Incorrect airspeed indications resulting from a clogged pitot tube. The readings were greater than the actual airspeed resulting in the crew reducing  power and leading to a stall. Failure of the crew to recognize the activation of the control column shaker as a warning of an imminent stall. Failure of the crew to carry out the procedures to recover the aircraft from the stall and restore lift. Crashed into a hill in heavy fog while on approach. The helicopter was shot down.

Brazilian pop group Mamanas Assassinas killed. Crashed and exploded north of it's destination in heavy fog after flying into a mountain ridge. Crashed after experiencing an engine fire. The pilot tried to make a forced landing but the engine and part of the left wing broke away. The pilot's improper decision to continue the flight rather than making an immediate water landing due to the low altitude of the airplane and obstructions ahead, which led to his intentional maneuver to avoid the obstructions and subsequent inadvertent stall and loss of control. The aircraft strayed off course and hit St. John Hill at an altitude of 2,200 feet, 16km SE of Dubrovnik while attempting to land in poor weather conditions. U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Ron Brown, 55, killed. Crew error.

Seven- year-old trainee pilot, Jessica Dubroff, accompanied by her father (a passenger) and the pilot-in-command, were engaged in a trans-continental record attempt involving 6,660 miles of flying in 8 consecutive days. The plane departed towards a nearby thunderstorm in deteriorating weather. Witnesses describe the plane's climb rate and speed as slow and they observed the aircraft enter a roll consistent with a stall. The plane's gross weight was 84 pounds over the maximum limit. Pilot's improper decision to take off into deteriorating weather conditions when the airplane was overweight resulting in stall caused by failure to maintain airspeed. After a number of failed landing attempts during a sandstorm, the aircraft made a forced landing in a local suburb crashing into a building. On a positioning flight the aircraft flew into a mountain. Crashed into high ground while attempting to land at a mine airstrip in turbulence and stong gusty winds. Crashed into a ridge line shrouded in clouds while en route. The aircraft crashed 18 miles NW of Miami airport  in a remote part of the Everglades. Shortly after taking off, after the crew reported fire and smoke in the cabin and cockpit. The in-flight fire was caused by activation of one or more oxygen generators in the forward cargo hold. The generators were outdated, improperly labeled, lacked safety caps and were prohibited from being transported on a passenger flight. The loss of control resulted either from flight control failure or incapacitation of the crew due to extreme heat and smoke.  Candi Kubeck was the first American female commercial airline captain to be killed in a crash. San Diego Chargers running back Rodney Culver, 26, and his wife were among the passengers killed as was singer, songwriter Walter Hyatt, 46. Crashed during a second attempt at landing Crashed during takeoff. The training flight crashed into a field during touch-and-go landings. The two helicopters collided in mid-air while flying in formation. The pilots may have possibly been  stressed fatigued and inadequately prepared and were flying too low to see the target. The aircraft overran the runway after an aborted takeoff. The fuel line in the No.3 engine was sheared and caught fire after the fanblade of the first stage HP turbine separated. During the slide the No. 1 engine and landing gear were lost ane the plane came to rest in a ditch. Three passengers were trapped in the wreckage and overcome by toxifumes after a fire started. Pilot error. Improper procedures used by the captain after engine failure. The aircraft crashed into a mountain after deviating off course during a landing attempt. Fan disk separation in the left engine. Pieces of the engine penetrated the passenger cabin killing two passengers. The fan hub for the left engine was found to be fractured and went undetected at time of manufacture. The crack should have been detectable during inspection but was missed. Just after beginning its final approach, the aircraft crashed into the side of a  mountain at about 9,200 feet in rain and poor visibility. The aircraft flew into a Bandi Hill while descending inbound to Kulu in heavy fog. Crashed and burned while attempting to land at Eindhoven Air Base. The aircraft collided with a large flock of lapwings and starlings, causing failure of the No. 1, 2, and 3 engines after which the port wing hit the ground and the plane exploded in flames. Aboard were members of a  Dutch Army Band returning from Italy. While on a flight from New York to Paris, France, the aircraft exploded at  FL 130, broke up and crashed into the AtlantiOcean off Long Island, N.Y. The NTSB determined that the probable cause of the accident was an explosion of the center wing fuel tank resulting from ignition of the flammable fuel/air mixture in the tank. The source of ignition energy for the explosion could not be determined with certainty but, of the sources evaluated by the investigation, the most likely was a short circuit outside of the center wing tank that allowed excessive voltage to enter it through electrical wiring associated with the fuel quantity indication system.  To say that numerous government agencies acted strangely and suspiciously would be an understatement.  A great deal of evidence was either suppressed or ignored. Rumors persist that the plane was brought down by a missile, either by the Navy conducting exercises in the area or by terrorists. Crashed 150 ft. short of the runway. Soon after takeoff, the No. 3 engine caught fire in the cargo plane. The pilot tried to return to the airport for an emergency landing but the right wing seperated and the plane crashed. Fatigue failure of the master connecting rod, which originated from corrosion pitting, subsequently compromised the engine crankcase, and resulted in a fire; and failure of the flight crew to follow emergency procedures by pulling the fire handle before feathering the propeller, which diminished the effectiveness of the fire suppression system. A straight-in visual approach to Mergui was being attempted when the aircraft entered a squall line of heavy rain. The aircraft then started to lose height quickly, undershot the runway by 800ft. And crashed into a ravine. After touching down, the cargo plane bounced twice and continued to the end of the runway, became airborne but crashed terrain. For unknown reasons, a decision was made to overshoot even though insufficient runway remained for acceleration, take-off, and climb. Likely contributing directly to the decision to overshoot was the difficulty in controlling the aircraft on touchdown. After taking off the  No. 2 engine of the cargo plane caught on fire. The pilot tried to land the plane in a river bed. The number 2 engine separated from the aircraft as a result of an intense fire in the wing. The loss of the engine rendered the aircraft uncontrollable, and the pilots were forced to land in the river. The plane struck a mountain. Failure of the crew to monitor the aircraft's position and flight path relative to high terrain surrounding Jackson Hole Airport. While en route, flew into the side of a mountain. The pilot probably made a navigational error because of restricted visibility in fog and light drizzle and entered the wrong valley, and he delayed his decision to reverse course until he was unable to avoid the weather. After taking off from Belgrade, the plane experienced electrical problems and returned to the airport. After dumping fuel and circling for 3 hours, the plane crashed into a corn field 800m short of the runway. The aircraft crashed 7 nm short of the runway into Operafjellet Mountain at an altitude of 2,900 ft. while attempting to land in poor weather. The crew did not use the usual approach which includes a turn over the ocean, but rather took a route that led through a narrow valley. Inadequate planning, unsatisfactory crew resource management and monitoring, not discontinuing the approach when procedural uncertainties existed and limited knowledge of the operating language and the actual airspace. The passengers were mainly Russian coal miners headed for a Russian mine on one of the Norwegian islands. The cargo plane crashed while approaching to land. The crew did not notice an incorrect heading due to an inoperative beacon and crashed into a hill. After taking off, the aircraft stopped climbing, struck a pole and crashed and burn. Improper installation of a connecting bolt in the throttle linkage, which resulted in a worn/disconnected throttle arm, partial loss of engine power, and a forced landing after takeoff. Shortly after takeoff from Texel, a connecting rod bearing in the No.1 engine failed. The prop was feathered.  Soon after, a part of the feathering mechanism failed and the prop started windmilling causing drag. The aircraft rapidly descended and crashed onto a mud-flat. The accident was initiated by a combined failure of the left engine and the left feathering system. The accident became inevitable when the flight crew allowed the speed to decrease below stall speed and lost control of the aircraft at an altitude from which recovery was not possible. The aircraft crashed into the ocean 28 minutes after taking off from Lima, Peru. Pieces of adhesive tape were found covering the statiports, placed there by personnel during aircraft maintenance and cleaning, causing the malfunction of the airspeed indicators and altimeters. The crew was not able to correctly determine their altitude and airspeed and with no ground reference over water and at night, crashed into the sea. An employee did not remove the adhesive tape from the statiports, nor was it detected by any number of people, including the captain, during the preflight inspection. A maintenance worker was tried and convicted of negligent homicide for failing to remove the adhesive tape and received 2 years in jail. Crashed on take off. While attempting to land the landing lights malfunctioned causing the cargo plane to veer off the runway and crash into a house. The cargo plane struck trees and a house while making a second attempt to land. The float plane crashed 55 minutes after departure into a 3,200 ft. mountain. Continued flight by the pilot into adverse weather condition, and his failure to maintain adequate altitude/clearance from mountainous terrain. Factors related to the accident were the high/mountainous terrain, and weather conditions that included low ceilings. 31-7952246The pilot reported that he had a rough running engine and was making an emergency landing at Charlo Airport. While maneuvering to land, he crashed 3 miles west of the runway. Loss of power from the right engine, and the pilot did not conserve altitude or configure the aircraft for maximum performance following the loss of power. Control of the aircraft was probably lost as the pilot was attempting to intercept the ILS for Runway 13 during a low-level turn. Contributing factors were the overweight condition of the aircraft and the lack of in-flight emergency procedures training received by the pilot. The cargo plane, carrying flowers and frozen fish crashed into the Dolorosa district, bursting into flames shortly after taking off. One engine caught fire during the climb-out. In a heavy snowstorm, the aircraft landed short and right of the runway striking three Mil Mi-8 helicopters and bursting into flames. The aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff into a residential area striking a building. Uncommanded deployment of the thrust reverser on the right engine. The plane crashed into a mountain 1 hour after take off, at an altitude of 900 ft., in strong winds, while on approach to Santa Elena. The pilot reported that an engine failed just as he started to descend for a landing. He later informed ATC he could not feather the propeller. The  aircraft subsequently crashed and burned in a field.  The accident was due to inappropriate management of the flight following jamming of the propeller in an intermediate position after the right engine crankshaft ruptured. The inappropriate management was due to the pilot’s relative lack of experience on this aircraft type, his false notions about the aircraft’s performance and about the existence of a flight level to maintain level flight with an unfeathered propeller and an heavy aircraft and a series of misjudged strategies to attempt to continue the flight then to land at Limoges when the aircraft’s altitude no longer made this possible. Crashed short of the runway in dense fog while attempting to land a second time at Lucapa. The plane crashed mid-way along its scheduled 50 minute route. The aircraft went into a roll and lost control after taking evasive action to avoid another aircraft. The plane was flying almost at the speed of sound when it crashed and disintegrated. ATC error. The controller thought he had cleared to aircraft to FL100 but the aircraft was still flying at FL240. Midair collision 17 km W of New Delhi.  The Saudi 747 had just taken off from New Delhi airport ascending to 14,000 feet while the Il-76 was descending. Three hundred twelve aboard the B-747 and thirty-seven aboard the Il-76 were killed. The Il-76 descended below its assigned altitude. The death toll was reduced from 351 to 349 after Kazastan Airlines reported 37 aboard rather than 39. Neither aircraft was equipped with an Airborne Collision Avoidance System. The 747 had taken off from Delhi and had been cleared to climb to FL140.  Meanwhile, the IL76, which was inbound to Delhi on the same airway, had been cleared to descend to FL150. However, due to a misunderstanding, the pilot and most of the cockpit crew of the IL76 believed the flight had been cleared to continue down to FL140. The Indian accident report attributed the failure of most of the IL76 crew to correctly understand the situation to their lack of a working knowledge of English. Also contributing to the crew's decision to continue the descent below their clearance limit were poor cockpit resource management, a lack of leadership by the captain, a lack of co-ordination between the crew and a general casual attitude to the conduct of the flight. Lost altitude and crashed while en route in poor weather. Icing. While landing on Runway 13 at Baldwin Field, the United Express collided with the King Air which was taking off on Runway 4. The collision took place where the two runways intersect. Both planes caught fire and rescuers were unable to open the door to the Beech 1900-C because of impact damage. All twelve aboard the United Express and the two pilots aboard the King Air were killed. King Air pilots' failure to use proper communications and 'see-and-avoid' procedures at an uncontrolled airport. Involvement of a third aircraft that transmitted unnecessary and inappropriate messages. Crashed 60 miles west of Cape Mendocino in the PacifiOcean. The crew reported losing an engine, followed by complete electrical failure. The aircraft was hijacked shortly after taking off from Ethiopia by three drunken escaped prisoners. They demanded to be flown to Australia, but wouldn't let the pilot stop to refuel. The plane eventually ran out of fuel and ditched 500 feet offshore of Le Galawa Beach on the island of Grand Comoros. When it was aparent the plane was out of fuel, the hijackers fought the pilot for control of the aircraft. In the last seconds aloft, the left wing tip struck the water and the plane crashed into the sea flipping at least once before breaking into several  parts. The water was shallow but many passengers had inflated their safety vests which prevented them from swimming out from under the cabin and they drowned. Shortly after taking off the cargo plane turn back toward the airport, increased it's bank angle until the aircraft hit the ground. Failure of the pilot to maintain control of the airplane, while maneuvering to reverse direction after takeoff, after encountering an undetermined anomaly. The undetermined anomaly was a related factor. The aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff. Overloaded. The aircraft crashed into a mountain 5 minutes after takeoff. The plane stalled while trying to clear a mountain.  Overloaded. After experiencing a No.2 engine fire and while attempting to return to the airport, the aircraft's wing struck a building short of the runway. Shortly after takeoff  the crew reported they had the right engine on fire. They attempted to return for an emergency landing but the cargo plane crashed right wing low, cartwheeled and burst into flames short of the runway. A fire within the right engine compartment of undetermined cause and the pilot-in-command's failure to maintain airspeed above the aircraft's minimum control speed. A factor contributing to the accident was the dark night environmental conditions Crashed 8km from the airfield after taking off in strong winds and heavy snow. The cargo plane crashed short of the runway while attempting to land. The cargo struck mountainous terrain after experiencing a stall during tests. The inappropriate control inputs applied by the flying pilot during a stall recovery attempt, the failure of the non-flying pilot-in-command to recognize, address and correct these inappropriate control inputs, and the failure of Airborne Express to establish a formal, functional evaluation flight program that included adequate program guidelines, requirements and pilot training for performance of these flights. Contributing to the cause of the accident were the inoperative stick shaker stall warning system and Airborne Express DC-8 flight training simulator's inadequate fidelity in reproducing the airplane's stall characteristics. Crashed while en route after the pilot reported an engine fire. Undetected cracks in the engine not detected during routine maintenance. The cargo plane was on a positioning flight when it struck rising terrain while making an approach to land. The captain's failure to maintain situational awareness, which resulted in the airplane being outside the confines of the instrument approach; and the crew's misinterpretation of a step-down fix passage, which resulted in an early descent into rising terrain. Factors included the captain's misreading of the instrument approach procedure, the crew's rushed and incomplete instrument approach briefing, their failure to use additional, available navigational aids, and their failure to account for the winds at altitude. While on approach the plane struck power lines and came to rest in shallow water. The pilot's continued VFR flight into instrument meteorological conditions. Factors in this accident were; fog, the low ceiling, and the dark night. Crashed onto a mountin in high winds and rain after being diverted from another airport. While on approach and attempting to land on runway 3R at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, in a snowstorm, the aircraft went into a steep dive and crashed into a field. The accident was caused by the FAA's failure to establish adequate aircraft certification standards for flight in icing conditions.  Contributing to the accident were the flightcrew's decision to operate in icing conditions near the lower margin of the operating airspeed envelope (with flaps retracted), and Comair's failure to establish and adequately disseminate unambiguous minimum airspeed values for flap configurations and for flight in icing conditions. While en rote the plane experienced engine trouble. The crew decided to divert to Sparrevohn. While attempting to land the plane encountered strong turbulence from surrounding mountains. Although full power was applied to the good engine the plane crashed into terrain. Loss of the right engine propeller control oil, which led to an overspeed of the right engine and propeller, and necessitated a shut-down of the right engine; and failure of the pilot to maintain adequate altitude/distance from terrain during visual approach for a precautionary landing at an alternate airport. Factors relating to the accident were: fluctuation of the left engine power, premature lowering of the airplane flaps, and an encounter with adverse weather conditions (including high winds, severe turbulence, and white-out conditions) during the approach. After being in a holding pattern for over an hour the plane hit trees and a  power line and crashed 700m short of the runway. The aircraft crashed shortly after taking off fromTambacoumba after losing power in the left engine. Fuel contamination. The plane took off from Luanda bound for Cafunfo in northeastern Angola when it disappeared en route.  Witnesses later stated the plane appeared to be in trouble and flying at a low altitude before it crashed. The two military helicopters crashed into each other while taking off in darkness killing all aboard. The aircraft touched down hard. The right main landing gear collapsed causing the plane to veer to the right and end up in a wooded area. The first officer was killed. Flew into a mountain while on approach. Slipped off the ice landing strip and flipped over. Shortly after taking off the plane flew into a mountain and was destroyed. The plane was carrying military personnel and their families and crashed 24 miles NE of Mashhad in the Binalud Heights. The pilot reported engine failure prior the crash. The aircraft lost altitude from FL 197 and crashed into a forest while en route from Stavropol, Russia to Trabzon, Turkey. Reports indicated that an in-flight  fire and an explosion led to the separation of the tail section prior to the crash. Superficial mechanical inspection of the aircraft which was carried out without the use of monitoring instruments and subsequent unjustified decision to extend the time between overhauls.  Inadequate monitoring to determine the state of structural elements and detect the presence of corrosion in hard-to-reach areas under the floor of the fuselage. Failure to carry out prescribed anti-corrosion measures on the aircraft structure during overhaul. While landing the aircraft overran the runway, hit a concrete drainage ditch, when through a fence and came to rest on a highway where it caught fire. On a positioning flight, while taking off the plane suffered engine failure, overran the runway and crashed into a vacant building. After making two approaches the pilot decided to head back to the departure airport. He flew north at an altitude beneath minimum radar coverage. The plane impacted the frozen ArctiOcean in a right bank and at a 60 degree nose-down attitude. The pilot's intentional VFR flight into instrument meteorological conditions and his failure to maintain altitude and clearance from terrain. A contributing factor was the weather conditions. The cargo plane became airborne but soon lost altitude and crashed to the ground and burst into flames. A stray bullet from training soldiers struck the landing plane, hitting an oxygen cylinder. A fire broke out and control of the plane was lost and it crashed. During the final stage of a visual approach, one of the aircraft's engines failed. The crew failed to correctly identify the problem and because of the flight regime, the propeller did not autofeather. The approach was continued, however, as the aircraft descended through about 2,000ft., power was applied at the start of a go-around. Control was lost and the aircraft crashed. The transport crashed into a mountain. The aircraft touched down hard, causing the nosegear to collapse. The pilot chose to to go-around. The aircraft climbed away but shortly after, the pilot declared an emergency and attempted to land on the runway in the opposite direction. The aircraft crashed on the runway, broke up and caught fire.The accident happened in poor weather with heavy rain associated with local thunderstorm activity. Crashed shortly after taking off. Fire in the cabin. The aircraft crashed while attemping to land. Windshear. Lack of windshear equipment at the airport. Shortly after taking off the cargo plane crashed into the ocean. The pilot lost control when he encountered severe weather conditions soon after taking off. While en route, the aircraft lost engine power and the pilot tried to land in a small lake but stalled and crashed into marsh. A loss of engine power due to the fatigue failure of the no.1 exhaust push rod. Shot down by rebels. An explosion caused explosive decompression and a six-foot hole in the side of the fuselage. One passenger was sucked out and killed.  A small bomb containing only 7 ounces of explosives was placed under a passenger seat.  It is reported that the police believed the bomb was planted as part of a failed suicide attempt by one of the passengers. The plane crashed into the ocean 4 miles off the coast shortly after takeoff. Possible failure of the left engine during takeoff. The sightseeing plane lost engine power and ditched in 39 degree water. Jamming/failure of the left magneto impulse coupling, which stopped rotation of the magneto gear, and resulted in subsequent shearing of the accessory intermediate idler gear. The aircraft developed engine trouble (left engine caught on fire) shortly after taking off.  While attempting to make an emergency landing at Sulaiman AFB, the plane clipped roof tops of a housing project and crashed into a nearby field. Crashed into Mt. Yasirua in poor weather. Navigational error. No published instrument flying procedures. No GPS used for primary navigation. On a training flight the instructor misread the Ranong DME and causing the trainee pilot to descend below minimum altitude in poor weather conditions. The aircraft  flew into high terrain. Overshot the runway in heavy rain and came to rest in brush. The aircraft touched down at excessive speed, far down the runway threshold, bounced twice and overran the runway. The aircraft crashed into Nimitz Hill, 3 miles short of Runway 06R, while making a non-precision approach in heavy rain to A.B. Won Guam International Airport. The runway glide slope system was inoperative. In addition, the Minimum Safe Altitude Warning system (MSAW) was also not working due to a software problem. The captain’s failure to adequately brief and execute the non-precision approach and the first officer's and flight engineer's failure to effectively monitor and cross-check the captain’s execution of the approach. Contributing to these failures were the captain's fatigue and Korean Air's  inadequate flight crew training. Contributing to the accident was the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) intentional inhibition of the MSAW at Guam and the agency's failure to adequately manage the system. Immediately after taking off the plane went into a nose-high attitude, stalled and crashed to the ground. The probable cause of the accident, which resulted from the airplane being misloaded to produce a more aft center of gravity and a correspondingly incorrect stabilizer trim setting that precipitated an extreme pitch-up at rotation, was (1) the failure of Fine Air to exercise operational control over the cargo loading process and  (2) the failure of Aeromar to load the airplane as specified by Fine Air. Contributing to the accident was the failure of the FAA to adequately monitor Fine Airs operational control responsibilities for cargo loading and the failure of the FAA to ensure that known cargo-related deficiencies were corrected at Fine Air. The aircraft flew into a mountain and exploded in flames after a missed approach and while executing a go-around in rain and high winds. The pilot turned right instead of left when initiating the go-around. French Canadian actress Marie-Soleil Tougas, 27, and  film director Jean-Claude Lauzon, 43, were killed when their Cessna crashed into a mountainside in strong winds and rain. They were returning from a fishing trip. While the cause of the accident is officially listed as unable to determine, an unexplained distraction and/or the effects of an optical illusion may have contributed to distracting the pilot's attention from flying the circuit. While flying at a low altitude the aircraft experienced engine trouble and crashed into trees. The engine failed due to fuel exhaustion. The pilot did not take advantage of suitable areas available for a forced landing. The aircraft stalled at a height from which recovery was not considered possible. While en route the plane went into a steep dive and impacted terrain. Collided with a Cessna 206 (OB-1450) and crashed 3 miles from the airfield. Six killed on the Pilatus and 6 on the Cessna The plane was on a flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Phnom Penh when it crashed while making an approach to Pochentong International Airport in heavy rain. The plane clipped palm trees and exploded in flames after crashing into a rice paddy, one-half mile from the runway. The only survivor was a one-year-old boy. Pilot error. The captain failed to heed the warnings of the flight engineer and first officer that the plane was flying too low and failed to abort the landing. Struck tree tops and crashed into Lambir Hill while on approach to land at Miri. The aircraft was destroyed when it flew into a hillside during an approach to Uvira. Midair collision at 39,000 ft. The Tupolev 154 aircraft was flying at the wrong cruise altitude which caused the midair collision. Twenty-four killed aboard the Tupolev and 9 aboard the C-141. Contributing factors included weak flight-following procedures of the Luanda ATC and  poor regional ground communications. The aircraft crashed into mountainous terrain 15 minutes before it was due to land at Medan on a flight from Jakarta. The aircraft crashed 20 miles from the airport. ATC error in directing the plane in the wrong direction into mountainous terrain that was obscured by smoke and haze due to forest fires in the area. Collided with terrain at the 9,900 foot level on the Uncompahgre Plateau. The pilot's failure to maintain sufficient airspeed for undetermined reasons while maneuvering the airplane near maximum gross weight and aft center of gravity in or near instrument meteorological conditions, which resulted in a loss of control and entry into a stall/spin. Crashed 3km short of the runway at Banjul International Airport in heavy rain and thunderstorms. The aircraft crashed  near Nuevo Berlin, a town on the banks of the Uruguay River, after changing its route to avoid heavy rain and hail. A crater 25 feet deep crater was created where the plane crashed into the earth.  Pitot heater failure. Crashed in poor weather. The aircraft had just finished performing 3 touch-and-go landings at Monterey Peninsula Airport. Shortly after taking off a fourth time, witnesses heard the engine make popping noises, bank to the right, pitch up, and go into a steep dive from about a  500 foot altitude and crash into the sea about 150 yards offshore. Singer John Denver, 53, who was piloting the plane, was killed. Denver, an experienced pilot with over 2,800 flying hours, had only a little over an hour in the experimental plane. The accident was caused by the inadvertent application of right rudder by the pilot as he attempted to manipulate the fuel selector handle. The unmarked fuel selector handle in this aircraft was located in a hard to reach area behind the pilot's left shoulder, instead of between his legs. This required removing his harness and reaching behind. While turning around, he inadvertently pressed down on the plane's right rudder pedal causing the aircraft to roll and go into a dive.  Contributing factors were, Denver took off with too little fuel in one tank which led to the necessity of switching to his backup tank. Also it was difficult to determine how much fuel was in the tanks due to the unmarked fuel quantity sight gauge. Crashed during a landing attempt. Crashed while en route. The pilot continued flight into adverse weather and lighting conditions which did not enable him to avoid collision with terrain. Contributing factors to this occurrence were the aircraft's unserviceability for single pilot IFR flight and the lack of guidance to company pilots as to weather limits for night VFR flight. A few minutes after takeoff a distress call was received from the aircraft after which it ditched into the sea 200 yards offshore. The pilot's disregard for lateral fuel loading limits, his improper removal of frost prior to takeoff, and the resulting inadvertent stall/spin. Factors involved in this accident were the improper asymmetrical fuel loading which reduced lateral aircraft control, the self-induced pressure to takeoff on time by the pilot, and inadequate surveillance of the company operations by company management. The military aircraft, bound for Vladivostok, crashed into a residential neighborhood twenty seconds after taking off. All four engines failed after the computer system began shutting them down shortly after takeoff.  Design flaw which led to uncoordinated operation of the high-pressure compressors. Crashed during the second approach right of the approach path. While the aircraft was being manoeuvred at a very low level in marginal weather, it descended after an abrupt turn and flew, in controlled flight, into the terrain. Crew procedural error. The aircraft was 1,000 pounds heavier than the maximum allowable weight.  The GPS installed in aircraft was not approved as a primary navigational aid. During take off, shortly after the landing gear was retracted, one of the aircraft's engines lost power and the propeller autofeathered. The aircraft rolled to the right, struck trees and crashed inverted. The aircraft crashed and burned while making an attempt to land. A number of errors by the crew resulted in the acccident. Not maintaining the height indicated during the last contact with the ATC. Not following instructions from the ATC. Crew fatigue and turbulence in the area contributed to the accident. Crashed after taking off from Mackenzie. Wreckage was found on the west shore of Williston Lake.  The cause of the accident is undetermined, however, it is probable that low-level, visual flight in deteriorating weather contributed to the accident. The aircraft crashed into Mt. Olympus while approaching Salonica, during a second attempt to land. The plane was holding at 3,300 feet due to heavy traffic. Tower tapes indicate that after the missed approach, the crew reported they were heading north when they actually were heading west. An investigation revealed the crew had poor training, flew too low, didn't know how to use the radar equipment and failed to declare an emergency after they missed the landing strip. A second crash occurred when a C-130 transport plane on its way to pick up troops to assist in the search, crashed into Pastra Mountain. The plane disappeared off radar screens and shortly after, crashed into the Musi River. The plane, almost brand-new, cruising in good weather and with an experienced crew, suddenly left normal flight from 35,000 feet and crashed at a high rate of speed into the Sumatran jungle. The right wing and parts of the rudder separated from the aircraft before it crashed. The Indonesian National Transportation Committee found that there was insufficient evidence to find a cause for the accident. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board strongly disagreed and stated the jet's cockpit voice recorder was intentionally disconnected and its flight controls placed in a nose-down position most likely by the captain. While the U.S. NTSB stopped short of using the term suicide, its dissenting report made it clear it believed the crash was the result of actions by the captain. In July 2004 a California jury found the manufacturer of the PCU valve that controls rudder responsible for the accident after the valve was located and showed defects which may have led to a rudder hardover. Crashed in the Pastra mountains while searching for the wreckage of an Aerosweet Yak-42 that was missing. Went missing while en route. May have been shot down. Two hours into the flight, at FL 310, the plane received reports of severe clear air turbulence in the area and the seat belt sign was turned on. Moments later, the aircraft suddenly dropped around one hundred feet seriously injuring many passengers and causing damage to the aircraft. The plane landed safely back at Tokyo, but  one passenger died of her injuries. Crashed into dense jungle, 4 miles short of its destination in heavy fog. During takeoff, the cargo plane drifted off the runway to the left returned, drifted to the right, over ran the runway, became airborne and collided with trees. The pilot's failure to remove the control lock prior to takeoff and his failure to abort the takeoff when he was unable to initiate a climb, resulting in the aircraft over running the runway and colliding with trees on the departure end of the runway. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's self-induced pressure to arrive at his destination to attend a family affair. The aircraft  was on a flight from Kandahar to Herat but was forced to return to Kandahar because of poor weather when it crashed into a mountain 70 miles north of Quetta in Khojak Pass. The last message from the pilot was 'we are running low on fuel.' Crashed due to fuel starvation. Fog and low visibility forced the plane to divert to divert to Brno. After a missed approach the aircraft crashed 3.5 km short of the runway threshold and was destroyed. The aircraft crashed on takeoff after the No. 2 engine failed and caused the aircraft to swerve off the runway and crash into an embankment and burst into flames. Flight 387 originated in Manila on a flight to Tacloban and Cagayan de Oro. The aircraft crashed while on approach to Cagay de Oro into a remote mountainous area.  Wreckage was found near the town of Pagalungan, NE of Cagay de Oro. The last radio message from the pilot was 'leveling off at 5,000 feet sir.'  The cockpit voice recorder revealed that the GPWS warned of terrain a dozen times just before impact. The crew apparently got lost in a cloud, never realizing they were headed into a mountain. Pilot error, inadequate training standards and deficient equipment. The aircraft struck and severed the cable to a gondola causing it to fall 300 ft. to the ground and killing 20 on board. The plane landed safely. Negligence by the crew in flying above the speed limit and well below the prescribed minimum altitude in the area. Shortly after taking off the plane lost power in the No. 3 engine followed by the No. 4 engine. The plane rolled to the right, stalled, entered an spin and crashed. Crashed in the Los Hoyos mountains while on a military training flight. Overshot the runway in heavy fog and crashed into the Sobat River. The aircraft was attempting to land at Taipei's international airport in rain and fog when the crew requested a go-around. The plane crashed into a residential neighborhood, ripping the roofs off several structures, skidding into a rice paddy and bursting in flames. DFDR data showed complete autopilot disengagement just after landing clearance. This was  followed by an attempted manually flown go-around with falling airspeed and a pitch-up of 40 degrees followed by a gain of 1,000 feet in altitude, total stall and a dive resulting in impact with the ground. The cargo plane was flying level when began to slow down, when into a nose-down pitch and crashed into a ridge. The pilot did not maintain control of the airplane due to undetected airframe ice, resulting in an inadvertent stall, and subsequent impact with the ground. Factors in this accident were: flight into clouds, below freezing temperatures, and the inability of the pilot to detect ice, due to the lack of an ice detection system to determine ice build up on portions of the airframe that are not visible from the cockpit. The cargo plane was making an ILS approach when control was lost and the plane impacted the ground 1.6 miles short of the runway. The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed during the approach which resulted in an inadvertent stall. Factors associated with the accident were the icing conditions and the pilot's low level experience in this make and model of airplane. The cargo plane struck the approach lights as it took off from Runway 3, then struck a hill and disintegrated. The aircraft crashed in the sea, 11 km off Hsinchu, shortly after taking off from Hsinchu. Instrument failure and loss of power in the aircraft's right engine in turbulence. The plane was descending for a landing at Kabul on visual when it struck 3,000 ft. Sharhi Baranta Mountain, 300 feet below the summit in dense fog and rain. The aircraft overran the 6,888 ft. runway, went through a concrete perimeter fence, crossed a small river and hit a karaoke house before stopping near a market. The plane was (legally) released from Manila with the No. 1 reverser deactivated. The plane landed mid-runway and the crew incorrectly used the No. 2 reverser to try and stop the plane causing it to veer to the right. The No. 2 engine was then to set to forward thrust steering the plane back on the runway.  A go-around was attempted but it was too late and the aircraft overran the runway. A Peruvian air force plane carrying villagers stranded by flooding crashed while attempting to land at Piura Airport. The pilot tried to glide the plane after losing an engine but crashed near a shantytown 2 kilometers from the airport. The plane began losing altitude after an engine failed and crashed into a drainage canal and broke in two. Engine failure. Shortly after taking off the cargo plane experienced a fire in the No. 2 engine. The plane crashed while attempting to make an emergency landing on a road. The aircraft, leased from TAME, crashed atop fog covered Cerro el Cable mountain and exploded into flames, three minutes after taking off from Bogota's El Dorado airport. The aircraft was leased to Air France by TAME airlines. The crew did not turn in the proper direction after reaching the Romeo non-directional beacon even though the flight crew acknowledged an air trafficontroller's warning that they were off course. The aircraft was chartered by the Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum Corporation. The plane crashed in light rain, while on final approach, in a swampy area, three miles short of Andoas. There were reports of a lightning flash preceding the accident. Crashed shortly after taking off in a sandstorm. The aircraft struck a jungle covered mountain at 1,800m, after making a premature descent to land during a heavy rainstorm. The helicopter's skids contacted a high-tension statiground wire about 150 feet above the ground. The pilot's failure to maintain altitude while operating in adverse weather. A contributing factor was the incoming fog and high tension statiwire. The aircraft crashed into the side of a mountain at 2,800m,  13 minutes after taking off from Erdenet. The plane, designed to carry a maximum of 19 passengers, was carring 26. Overloaded. Flight 420 took off from Montreal's Dorval Airport on a flight to Peterborough  About 12 minutes after take off, at an altitude of 12,500 feet, the crew advised ATC that they had a hydrauliproblem and requested clearance to return to Dorval. The crew then advised ATC that the left engine had been shut down because it was on fire. The crew decided to proceed to Mirabel International Airport. Then crew then advised ATC that the engine fire was out. On final for Runway 24, the crew advised ATC that the left engine was again on fire. The landing gear was extended on short final, and when the aircraft was over the runway, the left wing broke upwards. The fuselage inverted, struck the runway and slid 2,500 feet and came to rest on the left side of the runway.  PC: The crew did not realize that the pull to the left and the extended take-off run were due to the left brakes' dragging, which led to overheating of the brake components. The dragging caused overheating and leakage, probably at one of the piston seals that retain the brake hydraulifluid. When hydraulifluid leaked onto the hot brake components, the fluid caught fire and initiated an intense fire in the left nacelle, leading to failure of the main hydraulisystem. When the L WING OVHT light went out, the overheating problem appeared corrected; however, the fire continued to burn. The crew never realized that all of the problems were associated with a fire in the wheel well, and they did not realize how serious the situation was. The left wing was weakened by the wing/engine fire and failed, rendering the aircraft uncontrollable. The helicopter impacted a mountain on a sightseeing trip. The pilot's decision to continue VFR flight into deteriorating weather conditions consisting of lowering ceilings and visibility in mountainous terrain, which resulted in the inadvertent entry into instrument meteorological conditions and a collision with a mountainside. A factor in the accident was the failure of the chief pilot, who had directly observed the deteriorating weather conditions, to direct the following pilots to avoid the area. The cargo plane lifted off from the runway, slowly sank and impacted the sea. The plane was grossly overloaded. The cargo plane crashed short of the runway. While on an ILS approach, the cargo plane struck a hill. The aircraft crashed into a volcano. The plane was flying lower than 500 ft. prior to attempting to land. After a missed attempt the plane landed on the water and soon after water entered the cockpit and the plane broke up. Possible collision with debris which caused the doors to collapse inward. During a training flight, the crew of the cargo plane stopped one engine, stalled and crashed. The loss of control of the aircraft due to an excessive reduction of speed at low height, after having extended the landing gear, with an intermediate flap position, and with the right engine stopped and its propeller pitch close to feather. The aircraft ditched in the Manacapuru River while en route from Tefe to Manaus. The pilot had reported an engine problem about 20 minutes earlier. Shortly after taking off the plane pitched up, stalled and crashed to the ground. The  pitch-up was caused by an uncommanded downward movement of the horizontal stabilizer. This was due to a partial detachment of the actuator forward bearing support fitting due to the non-installation of required hi-lok fasteners. The aircraft touched down briefly, overran the runway and crashed into the sea in strong winds. Midair collision. The Beechcraft was on a flight from Lyon to Lorient, approaching Lorient, when it requested permission to fly over the ocean liner Norway. While circling the Norway, it collided with the Cessna. One killed aboard the Cessna, 14 aboard the Beechcraft.  Failure of both pilots to 'see and avoid' each other under VFR condition. The pilot made three low passes over the water in an attempt to land at Kincolith. On the fourth approach, the aircraft touched down, apparently in a controlled manner, and skipped on the water surface. The floats then dug into the water followed by the right wing, which was severed from the fuselage on water impact. The aircraft quickly overturned and came to rest inverted with only the bottom of the floats visible. All five occupants drowned. On touchdown, the floats struck the water and caused a flying attitude that the pilot could not control before the right wing dug in and the aircraft overturned. Contributing to the accident were conflicting wind and water conditions at the time of the occurrence. Blew a tire while landing causing the plane to to run off the runway and crash. While en route, the aircraft experienced double engine failure. The plane ditched into Foveaux Strait. Five passengers were rescued, but four passengers and the pilot did not have lifejackets and did not survive. The double engine failure was possibly related to fuel management. The aircraft crashed in a remote mountainous area at an elevation of 12,000 feet while on a flight from Jomsom to Potokari. Radio contact was lost 5 minutes after takeoff from Jomson. Impacted rising terrain while executing a go-around from Runway 09 at Melville Hall Airport.. The cargo plane took off in a steep angle, rolled to the left and crashed and burned. The taking off with the elevator trim set to the full nose-up position. This resulted in the nose of the aircraft pitching up after rotation, causing the pilot to lose control of the aircraft. The aircraft was on a flight from Rangoon to Tachilek when it was diverted to Heho due to poor weather conditions. After the aircraft was reported missing, wreckage was found on Payakha Mountain, near Manibagi.

The crew tried and failed twice to take off. On the third attempt, the plane struggled to gain altitude, rising a few feet, but settled back to earth plowing past the end of the runway and crashing into an auto body shop and coming to rest in a soccer field. The accident was caused by the late decision of the crew to abort the takeoff. Shot down by UNITA rebels 30 minutes after taking off. The aircraft was on a flight from JFK Airport, New York to Geneva, Switzerland when the crew reported smoke in the cockpit and requested an emergency landing at Halifax. The plane began dumping fuel and preparing for an emergency landing when it disappeared from radar and crashed into the AtlantiOcean southwest of Halifax. A fire in the entertainment system wiring started in a hidden area above the cockpit ceiling when arcing ignited the cover material made of thermal insulation blankets. This set off an in-flight fire that spread and increased in intensity until it led to the loss of the aircraft.. It was determined that  aircraft certification standards for material flammability at the time of the accident were inadequate. Dr. Jonathan Mann, researcher in the fight against AIDS killed in the crash. The plane crashed while attempting to cross a mountain pass, following two other company airplanes in conditions described as five to seven miles visibility, 700 feet ceilings, clouds hanging on the mountainsides, and misty rain. The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed which resulted in an inadvertent stall. Unfamiliarity with the geographiarea, the low clouds, his becoming disoriented, and the blind canyon into which he flew. The audible stall warning circuit breaker was found in the pulled (disabled) position. The aircraft was returning to a ramp with it's brakes on fire when it struck another aircraft and caught fire. The cargo plane was shot down by UNITA rebels. Struck Timika Peak at 11,800 ft. shortly after taking off. The aircraft hit the face of  mountain. The aircraft probably encountered a strong laminar downdraught before entering a thin cloud layer before impact.

The homebuilt plane was attempting to land at Lee Airport in Maryland when it crashed into Beard's Creek.  coming to rest  inverted in 18 feet of water. Actor, William Gardner Knight, 56, who was piloting the aircraft was killed. The pilot's failure to maintain adequate altitude/clearance from the trees. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's unfamiliarity with the geographilocation and dark night conditions. While en route, the cargo plane made a right turn in the vicinity of Beaver Point, and began to head towards high ground north of the Victoria airport. The aircraft then began a gradual, descending turn to the left in a southeasterly direction before striking trees near Mount Tuam peak.  The crew would have encountered the lower ceiling in the vicinity of Beaver Point. This lower layer of cloud would have restricted the crew's view of the ground lighting and reduced the ambient lighting available to navigate by visual means. With the loss of ground references, it is unlikely that the crew would have been able to perceive the divergence of the aircraft's flight path away from its intended track by visual means. The crew was unable to maintain separation between the aircraft and the terrain by visual means. Windshear or strong crosswinds caused the aircraft to crash as it was taking off. On a positioning flight, the aircrafted rolled over and crashed inverted 17 miles south of the airport it took off from. The pilot's in flight loss of control for undetermined reasons.

After encountering a vehicle on the runway, the crew attempted a go-around but the aircraft touched down in a nose-high attitude and crashed. The cargo plane crashed in fog and poor visibility while attempting to land. The plane crashed in dense jungle, 25 km from the departure town of Huambo. Heavy fighting was reported between government forces and UNITA rebels at the time of the crash. he United Nations-chartered plane was shot down by UNITA rebels, 20 minutes after takeoff from Huambo. During approach the cargo planel,assumed a nose-high attitude, stalled, hit a house and crashed into a field short of the runway. The aircraft was operated outside the load and balance limitations After completing an air refueling mission the plane pitched upward, stalled and crashed. Shortly after taking off, the cargo plane began to lose altitude until it hit trees, went off a cliff and crashed to a valley floor. The accident flight was not conducted in accordance with the night obstacle clearance requirements of Canadian Aviation Regulation. The Kelowna Flightcraft company operations manual did not reflect the restrictive conditions imposed on night visual flight rules (VFR) flight by CAR 705.32. Such information might have prevented the accident by ensuring the crew's awareness of those night obstacle clearance standards. After initiating a goaround, the aircraft veered left and commenced a shallow climb before suddenly rolling right and descending steeply onto a tidal flat. The pilot initiated a go-around from final approach because of a vehicle on the airstrip. The left propeller showed little evidence of rotation damage. The reason for a possible loss of left engine power could not be determined. For reasons that could not be established, the pilot lost control of the aircraft at a low height. While taking off the aircraft stalled, crashed and caught fire. Incorrectly set flaps for takeoff. The plane, on a relief mission to Bluefields was waved off from landing because of a blocked runway.

The aircraft was on a flight from Chengdu to Wenzhou when it crashed into a field while on approach to Wenzhou Airport. Witnesses saw the plane nose-dive into the ground from an altitude of 2,300 feet and explode. A self-locking nut, other than a castle nut with cotter pin as specified, had been installed at the bolt for connection between the pull rod and bellcranck in the elevator control system. The nut screwed off, resulting in bolt loss, which led to the loss of pitch control. While approaching New Delhi Airport, the plane suddenly veered off its landing path and crashed into a building site and careened into a water tank reservoir. A witness said the plane came in very low and crashed, exploded and burned after severing power lines. A heavy layer of fog covered the area prior to the crash. The crash site was 1.5 miles from the airport. Crashed into Huirotico Hill. Wreckage found 4 days later. On approach, the crew of the cargo plane descended to MDA and initiated a go-around after the runway was not seen.  On the second approach the captain descended below MDA and  the aircraft struck the ground in controlled flight 2 nm short of the runway. The aircraft was destroyed. The captain decided to descend below the minimum descent altitude without the required visual references. After descending below MDA, both pilots were preoccupied with acquiring and maintaining visual contact with the ground and did not adequately monitor the flight instruments; thus, the aircraft flew into the ice. The pilot-in-command lost control during touch-and-go landing and crashed. The aircraft departed Adana to pick up Turkish pilgrims. The plane crashed 9 minutes after taking off in poor weather conditions. Severe weather probably contributed to the cause of the accident.

Kennedy Jr., 38, crashed into the sea approximately 34 miles west of Martha's Vineyard while en route from Fairfield, New Jersey to Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. Killed along with Kennedy were his wife Carolyn and her sister Lauren Bessette. Kennedy's failure to maintain control of the airplane during a descent over water at night, which was a result of spatial disorientation. Contributing factors in the accident were haze, and the dark night. Crashed into a hill at 2,000 ft. while flying VFR in low clouds and rain while approaching Bluefields. The pilot-in-command descended below safe minimum height of 2,700 ft. Two minutes after taking off from Haneda Airport, a man carrying a knife forced a flight attendant to take him in the cockpit of the plane.  A fan of computer flight-simulation games, he stated he just wanted to fly a real plane.  After forcing the co-pilot out of the cockpit he ordered the captain to fly to a U.S. Air Force base in western Tokyo. When he refused, he stabbed the captain and seized the controls. After a sudden drop in altitude, the co-pilot and an off duty crew member entered the cockpit and overpowered the hijacker.  A one point the plane plunged to within 984 feet of the ground. The plane ultimately  landed safely but the captain died of his injuries. The plane crashed into Patascoy mountain at 7,000 ft. on a reconnaissance flight over drug producing areas. The plane crashed into a mountainside at an altitude of about 1,800 feet about 15 minutes after taking off from Nausori Airport bound for Nadi International Airport. The plane was observed by witnesses flying low prior to the crash. The wreckage indicated the aircraft descended until the right wing hit a line of trees at the 1,300 ft. elevation.

The cargo plane crashed while on approach. The plane crashed just after maintenance personell replaced parts and were testing the plane. The sightseeing plane crashed on the northeast slopes of Mauna Loa volcano on the island of Hawaii at an altitude of about 10,500 feet. The pilot's decision to continue visual flight into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) in an area of cloud-covered mountainous terrain. Contributing to the accident were the pilot's failure to properly navigate and his disregard for standard operating procedures, including flying into IMC while on a visual flight rules flight plan and failure to obtain a current preflight weather briefing. The helicopter, crashed into the water shortly after liftoff from the 88 foot tall helideck located 35 miles offshore. The landing was soft and gentle but the helicopter rolled over inverted in the water. Crashed on approach in low clouds, rain and low visibility. Crashed during a rainstorm. The plane scheduled to fly from Orlando, Florida to Dallas, Texas flew out of control for 1,500 miles before nose-diving into a grassy farm field in South Dakota, after running out of fuel. The plane's altitude varied between 22,000 and 51,000 feet during the flight.

The aircraft was observed in a 66 degree dive at 483 knots. The descent continued to 16,700 feet after which the aircraft climbed to 24,000 ft.   After that, the plane began a second dive and broke up at around 10,000 ft. crashing into the AtlantiOcean, 60 miles southeast of Nantucket Island.  The aircraft was named Thutmosis III. The accident was caused by the relief first officer's flight control inputs which caused the airplane's departure from normal cruise flight and subsequent impact with the AtlantiOcean. The reason for the first officer's actions were not determined by the NTSB. One could conclude the actions were deliberate in an attempt to commit suicide. A witness observed the aircraft approach the airstrip from the west, for landing to the east. While on final approach, power fluctuations were heard. The aircraft touched down on the approach end of the airstrip, then bounced into the air to about 20 feet. The witness then heard the pilot apply corrective power for about three to five seconds before full power was applied. Aircraft control was not maintained. The pilot's improper decision to abort the landing and flight into a box canyon were factors. Two Antonov 12 planes collided in midair killing all aboard and 6 on the ground. The plane was on a flight from Tujuana to Mexico City, with stops at Guadalajara and Uruapan. After reaching Uruapan, seventy-eight passengers deplaned.One minute after taking off from Uruapan, the crew declared an emergency without saying what was wrong.

The plane was on a flight from Rome, Italy to Pristina, Kosovo with a stop at Tirana, Albania. The plane disappeared from radar and crashed about 10 miles north of Pristina into a hill in poor weather. The plane was a U.N. charter flight on a routine humanitarian mission to distribute food. Lack of procedural discipline and vigilance during flight in mountainous terrain. Improper tracking by the military ATC. Crew fatigue.  Inoperable GPWS. Unable to gain altitude the cargo plane crashed back onto the runway. The cargo plane was taxiing for takeoff when a gust of wind caused the rudder to become fully defected to the left. The captain continued the takeoff despite suggestions from the crew to return to the gate. Shortly after lifting off the runway the plane yawed to the left and collided with the airport perimeter wall, bursting into flames. Shortly after takeoff, the pilot declared an engine failure. Seconds later he stated 'We are going down sir, we are going down.' The plane crashed 2 nm to the right of Runway 29 and burst into flames.  Failure of the exhaust pipe segment which caused the right hand engine to lose power and fail. The aircraft was overloaded. The company's lack of flight operations management experience. Crashed 49 miles from the departure airport. The pilot's continued VFR flight into instrument meteorological conditions. Factors associated with the accident were low ceilings, fog, and snow-covered terrain.

The executive jet descended below minimums and struck the side of a hill while attempting to land at Point Lookout. The pilot descended below the minimum altitude for the segment of the GPS approach. Factors relating to the accident were low ceilings, rain, and pilot fatigue. Two minutes after taking off the pilot was observed not following the correct flight path. When asked the pilot indicated he was having problems with his compass. He was advised to turn 90 degrees and climb as soon as possible to avoid terrain. There was no further radio contact. The plane crashed into the southern slopes of the Kvickberget mountains. The pilot was not qualified to fly at night and had 2 disorder which would have disqualified him from flying. Loss of control of the aircraft in IMC. Contributing factors were, poor weather, insufficient flight preparation, misaligned navigation system, the pilot distrusted the flight instruments and the plane was overloaded and tail-heavy. Crashed  2,900 ft. short of the runway causing extensive damage. The pilot was unable to get the aircraft airborne following the impact. Weather was below minima. Crew failed to monitor their instruments, became spatially disoriented and failed to arrest a high rate of descent. Pilot was inexperienced. The plane crashed 30 minutes after leaving Ponta Delgada, Sao Miguel Island bound for Horta, Faial Island in the Azores. The plane lost contact with the Horta control tower 10 minutes before it was scheduled to land.

While attempting to land at La Aurora International Airport, the aircraft overshot the runway, rolled down an embankment and crashed into houses in the La Libertad section of the city. Witnesses say the plane was unable to stop after it began its landing too far down the runway. The crew failed to initiate a go-around after overshooting on a wet runway with insufficient deceleration to make a safe stop. Leased from AOM. While on finals the training flight pitched up, the right wing dropped, and the airplane struck trees, struck wires, caught fire on a road. The pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane while on final approach resulting in the airplane striking trees. Factors in this accident were: improper planning of the approach, and not obtaining the proper alignment with the runway. The charter flight crashed in the Kahuzi-Biega National Park. Shortly after taking off the ADI comparator alarm sounded three times. Shortly afterwards, the warning sounded a further two times. As the captain initiated a procedural turn to the left, the comparator warning sounded 9 more times.. The aircraft then banked left progressively and entered a descent until it struck the ground in a 40 degree nose down attitude at a high rate of speed. The pilots did not respond appropriately to the comparator warnings during the climb after takeoff from Stansted despite prompts from the flight engineer. The commander, as the handling pilot, maintained a left roll control input, rolling the aircraft to approximately 90 of left bank and there was no control input to correct the pitch attitude throughout the turn. The first officer either did not monitor the aircraft attitude during the climbing turn or, having done so, did not alert the commander to the extreme unsafe attitude that developed. The plane was hijacked and subsequently flown to Amritsar, India, Lahore, Pakistan, al-Minhar Air Base, Dubai and Kandahar, Afghanistan. The hijacking lasted 7 days. One crewmember was killed. While on approach, after circling for 40 minutes and 5 miles from Valencia Airport,  the aircraft crashed into the Tocuyito mountain range and exploded in flames. The airport at Valencia was being used as operations at Simon Bolivar International Airport, Caracas had been disrupted by flooding in the region. The aircraft crashed 5 minutes after taking off from Simara.  The aircraft was observed not following the usual route into the mountains. While on a positioning flight the aircraft crashed into the Black Sea after stating they were diverting to Ankara Turkey. During a visual approach the aircraft stalled and pancaked 400 ft. short of the runway. The aircraft crashed shortly after taking off, 8 km from the airport in light rain. After departing, the captain turned the aircraft to the right instead of to the left. The first officer advised the captain he should be turning right and ATC also asked about the direction taken. ATC then cleared the aircraft for a right turn. Soon after, the pitch decreased rapidly accompanied by a marked speed increase and plane entered a high speed, high-rate, spiral descent and crashed into an open field. The flight crew reacted inappropriately to the change in departure clearance SID ZUE 1Y by ATC. The first officer made an entry in the FMS, without being instructed to do so by the commander, which related to the change to the SID ZUE 1 standard instrument departure. In doing so, he omitted to select a turn direction. The captain dispensed with use of the autopilot under instrument flight conditions and during the work-intensive climb phase of the flight. The captain took the aircraft into a spiral dive to the right because, with a probability bordering on certainty, he had lost spatial orientation. The first officer took only inadequate measures to prevent or recover from the spiral dive. The aircraft was on a flight from Tripoli to Marsa el-Brega Libya ferrying oil workers. As the twin engine plane approached Marsa El-Brega, the crew experienced a double engine failure and ditched into the sea. Failure of the crew to use the anti-icing system which led to the ingestion of melting ice into both engines causing failure of both engines. The aircraft was not able to maintain altitude after taking off and crashed into a house. The aircraft was overloaded. Lack of safety instruction to passengers. Flaps not properly selected. Took off with out clearance. The aircraft crashed near a pond 25 km from Cubuk, 20 minutes after taking off. Failure to use de-icing and poor weather was to blame. The aircraft crashed into the AtlantiOcean three minutes after taking off from Felix Houphouet-Boigny Airport.  A few seconds after lifting off the ground the stall warning sounded and continued for about 20 seconds until it was manually turned off by the crew. Three seconds later the plane impacted the water. The pilot's response to an alarm that inaccurately indicated the plane had stalled. The pilot failed to complete established procedure for such an emergency. Takeoff conditions also contributed to the accident, which occurred at night, hampering the crew's ability to judge the plane's distance from the sea. The military flight crashed after losing its engines after striking birds,unable to return to land. Engine problems forced the pilot to return to the airport. However, he overshot the runway and crashed into the sea. One passenger was rescued by fishermen. Major General Santiago Madrid, chief of the southwestern military command, killed. The aircraft crashed into the PacifiOcean south of Point Mugu in 650 ft. feet of water while en route from Puerto Vallarta to San Francisco. Radio transmissions from the plane indicated the pilots were struggling with a jammed stabilizer for the last 11 minutes of the flight before nose-diving into the sea. While preparing to make an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport control was lost and the MD-83 was seen in a nose-down attitude, spinning and tumbling in a continuous roll, inverted, before it impacted the sea.  Loss of airplane pitch control resulting from in-flight failure of the horizontal stabilizer trim system jackscrew assembly's acme nut thread. The component failed because of excessive wear resulting from Alaska Airlines' insufficient lubrication of the jackscrew assembly. Contributing to the accident were Alaska Airlines' extended lubrication interval and the Federal Aviation Administration's approval of that extension, which increased the likelihood that a missed or inadequate lubrication would result in excessive wear of the acme nut threads and Alaska Airlines' extended end play check interval and the FAA's approval of that extension, which allowed the excessive wear of the acme nut threads to progress to failure without the opportunity for detection. Also contributing to the accident was the absence on the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 of a fail-safe mechanism to prevent the catastrophieffects of total acme nut thread loss. Cynthia Oti, radio financial talk show host, Dean Forshee, guitarist, Jean Gandesberry, columnist, Tom Stockley, columnist were among those killed. Crashed on take off. The airplane impacted level terrain, covered by smooth, wind-blown, snow, in a left bank of 26 degrees or greater. The pilot's attempted flight into adverse weather, and his failure to maintain altitude/clearance above the snow-covered tundra. Factors associated with the accident were snow, rain, and whiteout conditions. The cargo plane lost altitude after taking off and crashed into a auto salvage yard and burned. A loss of pitch control resulting from the disconnection of the right elevator control tab. The disconnection was caused by the failure to properly secure and inspect the attachment bolt. While attempting to land at Burbank Airport, the plane overran the runway, collided with a metal blast fence and an airport perimeter wall and came to rest on a city street near a gas station. The plane touched down at 182 knots, 2,150 feet past the runway threshold, too fast and too far down the runway for the plane to stop in time.  In the accident sequence,  the nose gear collapsed, the forward service door (1R) escape slide inflated inside the airplane and  the forward dual flight attendant jumpseat, which was occupied by two flight attendants, partially collapsed. Two passengers sustained serious injuries and 41 passengers and the captain sustained minor injuries. The flightcrew's excessive airspeed and flight path angle during the approach and landing and its failure to abort the approach when stabilized approach criteria were not met. Contributing to the accident was the controller's positioning of the airplane in such a manner as to leave no safe options for the flightcrew other than a go-around maneuver. The aircraft climbed to an altitude of about 100 ft., stalled, lost control and crashed. Ice build up on the wings. Flaps incorrectly set. After lifting off the cargo plane entered a steep, nose-up attitude, banked to the left, and crashed. The pilot lost control of the aircraft while conducting a go-around from a aborted landing on the ice strip.  The aircraft's center of gravity on the accident flight was beyond the aft C of G limit. The crew did not recalculate the aircraft's weight and balance for the second flight. Leaks in the heater shroud allowed carbon monoxide gas to contaminate cockpit and cabin air. Crashed into a jungle mountainside 15 miles short of its destination while en route. The wreckage was found at the 2,500 ft. level of a 2,790 ft. mountain.  Weather was poor at the time. Crashed while attempting to land in poor weather. The pilot -in-command made two requests to land because he was low on fuel. While attempting to land, he ran out of fuel and crashed short of the runway. The Cargo plane broke into four parts and crashed into houses. The aircraft, leased from a Ukrainian company, overran they runway and crashed into a ditch after an aborted takeoff. Crashed shortly after taking off in fog. The pilot was not qualified to fly in IFR conditions. Shortly after takeoff the aircraft impacted another plane and crashed to the ground. The failure of the pilot's of both airplanes to maintain a visual lookout while climbing and maneuvering resulting in an in-flight collision and subsequent collision with residences and terrain. The aircraft circled Davao airport in an attempt to land but crashed onto a coconut plantation on the mountainous Samal Island. The plane aborted a previous landing attempt because another plane was on the runway. Weather and visibility were good in the area but the landing attempt may have been hampered by low-lying clouds. The last message from the crew was that they were 7 miles from the airport on final approach. Nothing more was heard from the plane. The aircraft disintegrated upon impact near Mt. Kalangan. The elevation of the accident site was about 500 feet above sea level but the plane should have been at a altitude of 1,500 feet. During a landing attempt the crew shut down No. 1 engine and declared an emergency. The plane was told to divert to Lyon Satolas. Power was applied to the remaining engine and the plane banked to the left causing the wing to touch the ground, crash and catch fire. Loss of yaw and roll control which appears to be due to the failure to monitor flight symmetry at the time of the thrust increase on the right engine. The cargo plane crashed into a cloud covered mountain. While on approach the charter flight hit the ridge of a mountain. Inadequate crew coordination led to the captain's decision to discontinue the instrument approach procedure and initiate a maneuvering descent solely by visual references at night in an area of mountainous terrain. The crew failed to review the instrument approach procedure and the copilot failed to provide accurate information regarding terrain clearance and let down procedures during the instrument approach. The charter flight crashed while on approach in fog and mist. The plane crashed into a heavily wood area  as it was making a second approach to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport. Visibility was poor in wind, low clouds and light rain.  While attempting the second approach, the pilot reported both engines had quit but restarted one of them before the plane crashed. Investigation revealed indications of rotation on the left engine at the time of impact but the power level was not known. The right engine and propellers exhibited little or no rotation at the time of impact. Failure of the crew to ensure an adequate supply of fuel for the flight, which led to the stoppage of the right engine due to fuel exhaustion and the intermittent stoppage of the left engine.  Failure of the crew to monitor the plane's fuel state and the flightcrews failure to maintain directional control after the initial stoppage. A hijacker robbed passengers, jumped out of the plane with a homemade parachute and was killed in the jump. Midair collision with a MD-83 after taxing on the runway. En route and descending at Whyalla,  at 6,000 ft., the pilot transmitted a MAYDAY, reporting that both engines of the aircraft had failed, that there were eight persons on board and that he was going to have to ditch the aircraft, but was trying to reach Whyalla. Three minutes later he reported his position 15 nm off the coast of Whyalla. No further transmissions were heard from the plane and the wreckage was found in Spencer Gulf the next morning. Malfunction of both engines due to the failure of components of the engines. A fractured connecting rod in the left engine led the pilot to increase the power setting in the right engine, leading to the No. 6 piston being holed in the right engine. The plane made a hard landing, short of the runway and broke in two during a heavy rainstorm. Engaged in an air ambulance operation, the plane crashed into the sea, in the estuary of the River Mersey, 0.8  nm from Liverpool Airport while on approach to land.  The pilot lost control of the aircraft at a late stage of the approach due either to disorientation, distraction, incapacitation, or a combination of these conditions. Fifteen minutes into the flight under foggy conditions and low ceiling, the aircraft entered a sharp descent and struck a tree and the ground. The plane was attempting to land at Whuan's Wanjiatun Airport in thunderstorms and heavy rain when it was struck by lightning causing it to explode and crash. Half of the plane crashed into a farmhouse and the other half crashed near a dike on the Hanjiang River near the village of Shitai, 15 miles from Wuhan. Seven people aboard a boat on the southern bank of the river were killed when they were swept into the river by the impact of the crash. Crashed into the sea during a test flight. The plane crashed into a heavily forested area 42 miles southeast of Villahermosa. There was fog and rain in the area  at the time.  Flying VFR, deviation to avoid weather resulted in spatial disorientation of the crew which led to descending below a safe flying altitude to clear high ground. The cargo plane had 19 people aboard when it crashed into a farm after losing the No. 2 engine, two minutes after taking off from Villavicencio. The plane, on a positioning flight crashed into rugged woods during an approach to land. The pilot's continued VFR flight into IMC conditions, by failing to maintain altitude, and descending from VFR conditions into IMC, which resulted in him subsequently impacting with trees. Factors in this accident were: reduced visibility due to dark night and fog. An additional factor was the pilot was not certified for instrument flight. While attempting to land at Patna, the aircraft was too high and the crew attempted a go-around. During the second landing attempt, the aircraft was again high, veered to left and lost altitude until it crashed into houses in the Gardanibagh district and burst into flames. The cause of the accident was loss of control of the aircraft due to crew error. The crew did not followed the correct approach procedure, which resulted in the aircraft being high on approach. The crew then initiated a 'go-around procedure' instead of an 'approach to stall recovery procedure' resulting in an actual stall of the aircraft, loss of control and subsequent impact with the ground. After declaring an emergency the cargo plane crew requested the nearest airport. The aircraft soon after descended out of control and crashed on the eastern side of the Meduxnekeag River. The pilot-in-command's failure to maintain minimum control airspeed, which resulted in a loss of control. Factors in this accident were clouds, and a loss of engine power for undetermined reasons, while in cruise flight above the airplane's single engine service ceiling. The cargo plane lost an engine on takeoff lost altitude and crashed 2 miles east of the airport. The helicopter, on a sightseeing tour, crashed into mountains on the western slopes of Maui at an elevation of 2,850 feet inclement weather. The aircraft struggled to gain altitude after taking off from Charles de Gaulle airport. The pilot reported the No. 2 engine failed and struggled to steer towards Le Bourget airfield as smoke and fire trailed the jet's left wing.   The plane was unable to gain altitude, went nose high, stalled and crashed into a small hotel complex.  A metal strip left on the runway by another plane gashed one of the Concorde's tires which blew out sending a piece of rubber into the underside of the wing which sent a shockwave which ruptured a seam in the fuel tank. An electrical severed by another piece of rubber sparked which ignited leaking fuel ignited and started an uncontrollable fire. Power was lost to the No. 1 and No. 2 engines which led to loss of control of the aircraft and subsequent crash. Investigation revealed the metal strip was probably a thrust reverser part from Continental Airlines DC-10-30 , registered N13067 which departed Paris as Flight 055 to Newark. This is the first crash of a Concorde in aviation history. Crashed on a training flight. The aircraft crashed into the Churia mountain range at 4,300 ft., 20 minutes into a 30 minute flight to Dhangadhi in rain and fog. The helicopter exploded and crashed from a height of 1,000 ft. The aircraft crashed into a volcano after the pilot reported he was diverting to Puerto Montt because of ice formation on the wings. The wreckage was found 15 days later. The two aircraft collided over a central New Jersey subdivision, scattering debris over a wide area. The Navajo had taken off from Lakehurst Naval Air Station and the Seminole from Northeast Philadelphia Airport.  The Navajo crashed into a two-story house while the Seminole fell into a soybean field. Two pilots and seven passenger were killed on the Navajo as were a pilot instructor and his student on the Seminole. Failure of the pilots of the two airplanes to see and avoid each other and maintain proper airspace separation during visual flight rules. The plane was approaching Tshikapa and the pilot informed the tower that it was having difficulties with its landing gear. The tower told the pilot to do a low fly-by for an evaluation and then make an emergency landing but the pilot refused and attempted to return to Kinshasa. The plane crashed 40 miles north of Tshikapa. The float plane took off, entered a steep climb, stalled and crashed into the water. The pilot's decision to depart from the unlit location was likely the result of the many psychological and physiological stressors encountered during the day. The pilot most likely experienced spatial disorientation precipitated by local geographiand environmental conditions and lost control of the aircraft. While on approach the airplane collided with trees and the ground and subsequently burst into flames.  Pilot's failure to follow instrument procedures and descended below approach minimums and collided with trees. The aircraft crashed into the Persian Gulf and exploded in flames while attempting to land at Bahrain International Airport. The crew decided to perform a missed approach after it was determined the aircraft was coming in too high and fast. Instructions were given for a 180 degree turn and climb to 2,500 feet. While performing the missed approach the plane suddenly descended rapidly from an altitude of 1,000 feet and crashed into the shallow waters of the gulf approximately 1 mile from the airport. The accident was a result of a fatal combination of factors, including the captain's failure to comply with standard operating procedures and the copilot's actions in not drawing the captain's attention to the deviations of the aircraft from the standard flight parameters. The captain may have suffered a 'spatial disorientation' to ground warning systems, which could have made him falsely perceive the aircraft was pitching up. He responded by making a nose down input, resulting in the aircraft starting to descend, when aircraft warning systems were saying he should increase altitude. The aircraft, was on an around-the-island tour when it's right engine caught fire. While attempting an emergency landing at Hilo International Airport, the plane ditched into Hilo Bay. Eight people escaped from the plane before it sank in 100 feet of water. One passenger was not able to exit the plane and drowned. Possible failure of the turbo unit on the right engine. The plane crashed head-on into 5,360 ft. Arenal volcano, 95 miles north of San Jose shortly after taking off from La Fortuna. The pilot was flying VFR and deviated from his course by 12 miles, most likely to give passengers a view of the volcano which had erupted earlier in the week. The reason the crew did not see the volcano is not known. Possibly, with changing meteorological conditions in the area, the volcano may have been obscured by clouds. The plane, built in 1998, had been leased from Aeroperlas. Flew into Mt. Montezuma. Shortly after departing Perth and after the aircraft had climbed through its assigned altitude, the pilot’s speech became significantly impaired and he appeared unable to respond to ATS instructions. Open microphone transmissions over the next 8-minutes revealed the progressive deterioration of the pilot towards unconsciousness and the absence of any sounds of passenger activity in the aircraft. No human response of any kind was detected for the remainder of the flight. Five hours after taking off from Perth, the aircraft impacted the ground 65 km ESE of Burketown, Queensland, and was destroyed. Incapacitation of the pilot and passengers a result of hypobarihypoxia due to the aircraft being fully or partially unpressurised and their not receiving supplemental oxygen. The investigation could not determine the reason for the aircraft being unpressurised, or why the pilot and passengers did not receive supplemental oxygen. The Air Force helicopter was on a domestiflight when it cashed into mountainous terrain 75 km from Colombo. The helicopter’s pilot had contacted air trafficontrollers saying he had problems with visibility and was lowering his altitude. Sri Lanka, Muslim Congress leader M. H. M. Ashraff, 52, along with members of his entourage were killed. The belly cargo pod  lightly scraped the runway for about 40 feet, but the airplane transitioned to a climb. As the airplane began climbing away from the runway, the landing gear was observed to extend. The airplane climbed to about 100 to 150 feet above the ground, and then began a descending left turn. The airplane collided with the ground on a 095 degree heading. The wreckage path extended for about 300 feet, during which the landing gear, left wing, and the left engine separated from the airplane. A postcrash fire destroyed the fuselage, right wing, and the right engine. The pilot's failure to extend the landing gear, his improper aborted landing procedure, and inadvertent stall/mush. Factors in the accident were an improper adjustment of the landing gear warning horn system by company maintenance personnel, and the failure of the pilot to utilize the prelanding checklist. The aircraft overshot the runway near Reynosa, Mexico and crashed into vehicles and houses coming to rest in a canal. The accident happened during a heavy rainstorm. The lights at the airport were out due to the storm and contact with the tower was lost. No passengers were killed aboard the aircraft but four people were killed on the ground. Destabilized approach, attempted to establish runway alignment, insufficient altitude, struck a tree. The aircraft crashed and caught fire. The chartered cargo plane hit tree tops and discintegrated while attempting to land. Although the pilot and the aircraft were certified for instrument flight, the pilot apparently continued to fly in accordance with visual flight rules after encountering marginal weather conditions and reduced visibility. For undetermined reasons, the pilot descended below the elevation of the terrain surrounding the airstrip, resulting in a controlled-flight-into-terrain accident. After receiving special VFR clearance the cargo plane flew into a small hill. The pilot's attempted flight into known adverse weather conditions, and his subsequent failure to maintain altitude above, or clearance with, trees. Factors contributing to the accident included low ceilings, fog, the pilot's low-altitude flight, rising terrain, and trees. The cause of this accident was the pilot's excessive takeoff rotation, during an aft center of gravity takeoff, a rearward migration of fuel during acceleration and takeoff and consequent shift in the airplane's aft c.g. to aft of the aft c.g. limit, which caused the airplane to stall at an altitude too low for recovery. Contributing to the accident were Bombardier's inadequate flight planning procedures for the Challenger flight test program and the lack of direct, on-site operational oversight by Transport Canada and the Federal Aviation Administration. The twin engine Cessna crashed into a densely wooded area, 30 miles south of St. Louis, 25 minutes after taking off from Parks Airport. The plane was flying in rain and fog when the pilot reported he was at 6,500 feet and having problems with the artificial horizon. Radar contact was soon lost with the aircraft.  Witnesses reported hearing a plane in a dive followed by an explosion.  Wreckage was scattered over a wide area.  Mel Carnahan, 66, Governor of Missouri was killed in the accident along with a campaign aide and his son, Roger, who was piloting the plane. The aircraft crashed into a mountain at 4,800 ft., in poor weather, while making an apporach to Sam Neua. Communications were lost with the aircraft as it approached Mt. Tirina at 4,250 feet, preparing to land at Batumi. The aircraft was seen rapidly descending into mountainous terrain. A large explosion followed as the plane crashed somewhere between the towns of  Batumi and Kabuleti in heavy rain. Navigation error made by the crew in the final stage of the landing approach. Error by the Batumi ATC who failed to locate the plane and conform it to the crew. Erroneous data shown by ground radio-technical facilities at Batumi airport. Weather conditions at the time were extremely poor due to typhoon Xiang Sane. A NOTAM issued on Aug 31, 2000 indicated that Runway 05R was closed due to construction between Sep 13 and Nov 22. After reaching the end of Taxiway NP, the plane turned onto Taxiway N1 and then made a 180-degree turn onto Runway 05R and began its takeoff roll. Approximately 3.5 seconds after reaching V1, the aircraft hit construction equipment on the runway, crashed back to the ground, broke up and burst into flames. The pilot attempted to take off from a closed runway. The following factors contributed to the accident. Of three lights used to guide the aircraft onto the correct runway, one was not working and another dim. The airport lacked 'guard lights' used to help pilots navigate from the taxiway to the correct runway during times of poor visibility. International regulations require that a large white X be placed on the tarmaat the entrance to a closed runway, but there was none at the entrance of runway 5R. Whether there should have been, in this case, however, is itself a contentious matter as the runway remained open for taxiing. The aircraft exploded in midair 20 minutes after taking off from Saurimo. UNITA rebels claimed they shot down the plane. Due to a blown tire on takeoff the pilot aborted the takeoff, overran the runway, came to rest in a cemetery and caught fire. During takeoff, the cargo plane struck trees, crashed and caught fire. The indicated failure of the right hand AC bus during takeoff with low ceiling. The factors were the low ceiling, night, and the execssive workload the pilot experienced on takeoff with an electrical failure without a second in command. The plane crashed and exploded in flames into an open field 3 miles from the runway shortly after takeoff.  Engine failure. After climbing through 16,000 ft. the crew descovered cabin pressure could not be maintained and returned to the airport.  After landing the ram air switch failed to depressurize the aircraft. Moments later the left foreward door exploded open ejecting a flight attendant onto the tarmac. During the approach, the plane, on a positioning flight, hit electrilines, then the ground and finally an unoccupied building. Crashed into the Great Salt Lake with skydivers during a final approach to Tooele. The pilot's exercise of poor judgment and his failure to maintain a safe altitude/clearance above the water. Contributing factors were the weather conditions that included low ceiling and visibility obscured by snow and mist, an inadequately equipped airplane for flying in instrument meteorological conditions, and the pilot's overconfidence in his personal ability in that he had reportedly done this on two previous occasions. The cargo plane crashed on Table Top Mountain while en route. The airplane flightcrew's failure to maintain adequate distance/altitude from mountainous terrain during a departure climb to cruise flight, and the captain's impairment from drugs. Factors in the accident were dark night conditions, and the first officer's impairment from drugs. The plane caught fire shortly after taking off from Ciudad Bolivar where it had made a refueling stop. The pilot was unable to tell the tower what was wrong before rolling inverted and crashing into a neighborhood south of the city. While attempting to land at Mitú, the cargo plane's landing gear struck the ground short of the threshold. A go- around was executed but the No. 1 engine was shut down because of low oil pressure. The plane flew over the control tower twice to determine the state of the landing gear. It appeared that part of the left main landing gear was missing. The crew then positioned the plane for an approach and landing. As the plane turned into long final, it struck the ground, crashed in a meadow and caught fire. Impacted trees and crashed while attempting to land. The flightcrew not maintaining altitude/clearance during the circling instrument approach. Factors were the pilot in command initiating the flight without proper weather reporting facilities at the destination, the flightcrew not flying to an alternate destination, the flightcrew not following company and FAA procedures/directives, the lack of certification of the second pilot, the operator not following company and FAA procedures/directives, and the dark night and the low ceiling. The plane experienced asymetrical thrust during takeoff. Rose 200-300 ft., stalled and crashed into trees. An in-flight failure of the left power plant appromately 3 minutes after take-off and inadequate conduct of the crew  so that in short final the airplane stalled and crashed from low height. The failure of the left engine was caused by intergranular fractures of retention posts on the high pressure turbine disk. As a result of incorrect service life recordings the maximum number of cycles had considerably been exceeded. After losing radio contact with the airport, the aircraft was observed flying low before crashed into a mountainside 2 nm from Jakobkondre. Double engine failure on take off cause the cargo plane to ditch in Firth of the Fourth estuary. Icing. Just after rising the plane stalled while making a turn and crashed and burned. The aircraft exploded and caught fire 35 minutes before its scheduled takeoff. Five members of the cabin crew were the only people aboard the plane at the time. Witnesses said they heard an explosion before flames erupted aboard the aircraft. NTSB investigators reported that the center fuel tank exploded followed by the right tank 18 minutes later. The cause for the explosion was unclear. The center fuel tank is located near air conditioning packs which generate heat, and were running nonstop prior to the explosion. The plane was on a flight from Florida to Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia when witnesses observed the plane gliding down and losing altitude until it impacted the ground, exploding into flames. Heavy rain and wind were present in the area at the time of the accident. Weight imbalances in the aircraft were the primary cause of the accident as the cargo shifted when the pilot  got up and walked through the plane toward the rear of the plane, unbalancing the aircraft just as it hit severe turbulence. This led to the loss of control and break-up of the aircraft. The plane was hijacked and flown to Medina, Saudi Arabia. The plane was stormed and three people killed. The aircraft crashed into a mountain at 6,500 ft. while approaching Lubango to land. The weather at the time was cloudy with rain. The aircraft took off from Prinses Juliana Airport at St. Maarten for a 15 minute flight to St. Jean Airport at St. Barthélémy. While attempting to land at St. Barthélémy the plane veered sharply to the left and plunged straight down crashing into a house and bursting into flames. Weather was good at the time of the accident. While approaching Juanda for the 8th touch-and-go landing the aircraft banked to the left, crashed and caught fire. The aircraft was on final approach to Sardy Field when it crashed short of the runway into a hill northwest of the airport killing all aboard. The jet crashed into a small hillside 500 yards short of the runway, jumped over a culvert and crashed into another bluff exploding in flames. Wreckage was strewn over 100 yards. There was light snow and mist reported in the area at the time of the accident. The flight crew's operation of the airplane below the minimum descent altitude without an appropriate visual reference for the runway.  The crew was also under pressure to land before a landing curfew took effect. The positioning flight crashed into a building shortly after taking off. The pilot not maintaining aircraft control while maneuvering after takeoff and the pilot's inadequate preflight planning and preparation. Factors relating to the accident were the pilot's diverted attention while maneuvering after takeoff, the pilot's attempted VFR flight into instrument meteorological conditions, the pilot's visual lookout not being possible, the low ceiling, snow, and fog, the airplane's low altitude, and the building. The aircraft crashed on takeoff during a sandstorm, killing Sudan's deputy defense minister and 13 high-ranking military officers. The helicopter, carrying members of Full Account, a group searching for the remains of U.S. troops missing in action during the Vietnam War, crashed into a mountainside in heavy fog. The aircraft crashed into rugged farm land, 120 miles south of Buenos Aires. Possible icing.  Agostino Rocca, president of the Buenos Aires-based Techint  construction group and German Sopena, managing editor of the Argentine newspaper La Nacion, were among those killed. The aircraft went into a steep dive from 17,000 feet and crashed into a field. Hydraulifailure caused by ice. Shortly after taking off the plane veered to the right and crashed into a field. Engine failure. The aircraft crashed into mountains about 12 miles south of Sari, 55 minutes after taking off from Tehran on a flight to Gorgan. Shortly before the tower lost contact with the plane the pilot reported bad weather and said he was thinking of returning to Tehran. Transport Minister of Iran, Rahman Dadman, 45, killed. Crashed while en route. The aircraft returned to Sentani Airport after experiencing engine trouble, skidded off the runway and struck a fence. The plane crashed and exploded in flames in Siberian woodlands near the village of Burdakovka, about 21 miles from Irkutsk. The aircraft crashed during the third turn in a landing approach to Irkutsk, an intermediate stop for refueling. The first officer was flying the plane, when at 2,600 ft., an audible alarm sounded indicating a wide angle of attack. Eleven seconds later the aircraft swung around 180 degrees and entered a flat spin. The captain ordered the engines at full throttle but it was too late and 22 seconds later the plane hit the ground, belly first, broke up and burned.\\xa0Incorrect actions of the crew. Due to poor communication between pilots, they put in the wrong parameters while landing causing the plane to descend at the wrong angle. As a result, the plane stalled and entered a spin and crashed. After several delays in taking off, the helicopter crashed into the sea, just off shore, after striking a electritransmission tower. The accident took place in heavy monsoon rains, poor visibility and high winds. The pilot stated he lost control of the helicopter when it was hit by a sudden gust of wind. The aircraft crashed and burned moments after taking off from General Bartholomew Salóm Airport during a National Guard demonstration. The right engine appeared to have failed at a critical stage in the takeoff. There were 8 civilians and 5 military personnel board. The cargo plane was taking off from Chkalovsky Airport with a load of construction material and cosmetics. After reaching a height of 150 feet, the plane the crashed and burned 1,600 feet past the end of the runway.  The plane was overloaded by 15 tones. The sightseeing plane impacted the side of a mountain in poor visibility. The pilot's continued flight into known adverse weather conditions, and his poor in-flight decision making. Factors associated with the accident were clouds and mountainous terrain. A finding is the pilot's use of FAA prohibited drugs. The cargo plane crashed into a hill and broke up. Crew did not follow standard operating procedures. Crew fatigue. The sightseeing helicopter crashed and burned about 3,700 feet up the 5,600-foot Grand Wash Cliffs just outside the boundaries of Grand Canyon National Park. The aircraft was returning to McCarran International Airport where it had originated. Besides the pilot, all victims, including the one survivor, were members of the same family. The pilot's decision to maneuver the helicopter in a flight regime and in a high density altitude environment which significantly decreased the helicopter's performance capabilities, resulting in a high rate of descent from which recovery was not possible. Factors contributing to the accident were high density altitude and the pilot's decision to maneuver the helicopter in proximity to precipitous terrain, which effectively limited remedial options available. After an engine failed the crew declared an emergency and elected to divert to Bukavu but crashed 10 km short of the airport. The crew reported that they had a loss of fuel and were going to have to divert to Lajes. Shortly thereafter, they said that they only had five minutes of fuel and probably would not reach Lajes. The Airbus 330, without engine power, glided for almost 20 minutes, descending from for more than 30,000 ft. before landing safely at Lajes Airport. Several tires blew out causing a fire which was quickly extinguished by emergency crews.  Eleven passengers were slightly injured. The leak was caused by a damaged fuel feed pipe that was caused by interference from the aft hydraulipump. Mechanics did not completely follow a Rolls-Royce service bulletin. In addition, software mistakenly identified the  fuel leak as a fuel imbalance, prompting the crew to respond erroneously to the situation. The official report stated the cause was the pilots responded incorrectly to the fuel leak.  The pilots acted from memory rather than utilizing a checklist, so they never saw a 'Caution' note in the Fuel Imbalance checklist that might have caused them to consider that the real problem was not an imbalance but a fuel leak. Shortly after taking off the cargo plane crashed into a wooded area about one-half mile from the runway. The pilot's failure to maintain a proper climb rate while taking off at night, which was a result of spatial disorientation. Factors in the accident were the low visibility and cloud conditions, and the dark night. The aircraft crashed in flames approximately 200 ft. past the end of the runway while attempting to take off. The plane was overloaded by several hundred pounds and the weight improperly distributed, causing the pilot to lose control of the aircraft. R&B singer and actress Aaliyah Haughton, 22, was among those killed. Traces of cocaine and alcohol were found during the autopsy of the pilot. The plane was overloaded. The aircraft crash-landed on a highway near Ruiz Picasso Airport in Málaga. While on final approach, the pilot reported failure of the plane's left engine forcing the crew to make an emergency landing.  The plane crashed 1,300 ft. short of the runway. The pilot later died of his injuries. The aircraft was hijacked after taking off from Newark International Airport. The hijackers took control of the aircraft and turned the plane towards Washington D.C.  A struggle ensued between the passengers and hijackers after which the plane crashed at a high rate of speed into a field in the Pennsylvania countryside. It was one of four planes that were hijacked the same day. The aircraft was hijacked after taking off from Dulles International Airport. The hijackers took control of the aircraft and deliberately crashed it into the Pentagon. It was one of four planes that were hijacked the same day. The aircraft was hijacked shortly after it left Logan International Airport in Boston. The hijackers took control of the aircraft and deliberately crashed it into the north tower of the World Trade Center between the 94th and 99th floors at approximately 450 mph.  After 102 minutes, the building collapsed. It was one of four planes that were hijacked the same day. The aircraft was hijacked shortly after it left Logan International Airport in Boston. The hijackers took control of the aircraft and deliberately crashed it into the south tower of the World Trade Center between the 78th and 84th floors at approximately 550 mph. After 56 minutes, the building collapsed. It was one of four planes that were hijacked the same day. The aircraft crashed 4.4 miles from Kura Airport shortly after a normal takeoff. The plane was flying at about 1,500 feet when it began turning onto a course requested by the air trafficontroller. It did not stop turning and suddenly plunged to the ground. While the aircraft was over Belo Horizonte, the cabin depressurized, causing the death of one passenger. The aircraft made an emergency landing at Cofins. Three of the other 77 passengers aboard suffered minor injuries. Pressurization was lost at an altitude of  33,000 feet when the right engine disintegrated, causing pieces of the engine to break two cabin windows. The aircraft was taking off from Guatemala's Aurora Airport when it lost power in one of it's engines and crashed to the ground. Witnesses to the accident reported that shortly after departing from the northbound turf runway the pilot initiated a 360-degree turn to the right (east). Shortly before completing the turn, the aircraft banked sharply to the left, pitched down, and collided with trees in a nose-low attitude. The pilot's failure to maintain airspeed during a low altitude turn, resulting in a stall. The pilot exceeding the aircraft's maximum gross takeoff weight was a factor. The aircraft exploded in mid-air at 36,000 ft. while  en route over the Black Sea. The plane then nose-dived crashing into the water. The airliner was brought down accidentally by a Ukrainian surface-to-air missile, fired during military exercises. The aircraft was taking off from Linate Airport in fog and poor visibility when it struck a German Cessna Citation II business jet. The MD-87 then swerved off the runway and  collided with the airport's baggage handling building, bursting into flames. The Cessna,  which was about to take off for Paris, entered the active runway by mistake, after  having been told by the tower to enter a different runway. One hundred four passengers and 6 crew on the MD-87 and  2 passengers and 2 crew on the Citation were killed along with 4 on the ground. The MD-87 was named Lage Viking.  Caused largely by human error and poorly followed safety procedures. Communication between the aircraft and the tower had been 'in English and Italian,' as opposed to aviation standards that only English be spoken. In addition, despite the poor visibility, control tower operators failed to ask the Cessna to read back his instructions to make sure they were understood. The seaplane crashed into Mollet Lake while attempting to land. The seaplane stalled at an altitude that did not allow the pilot time to recover from the stall. The stall occurred in circumstances conducive to illusions created by drift. Shortly after taking off from Dillingham, the aircraft's wing dipped, the nose pitched up, the plane became inverted and crashed to the ground. The weather was clear and windy at the time of the accident. An in-flight loss of control resulting from upper surface ice contamination that the pilot-in-command failed to detect during his preflight inspection of the airplane. Contributing to the accident was the lack of a preflight inspection requirement for CE-208 pilots to examine at close range the upper surface of the wing for ice contamination when ground icing conditions exist. The plane was en-route from Barcelona, Spain to Oran, Algeria, 80 miles off the coast of Valencia, Spain when it informed Valencia ATC it was going to change course in order to avoid bad weather. There was no further contact with the aircraft. Debris was sighted two days later on the water. The air ambulance was flown into terrain during an overshoot because the required climb angle was not set and maintained to ensure a positive rate of climb. During the go-around, conditions were present for somatograviillusion, which most likely led to the captain losing situational awareness. Thirty minutes into the flight both engines quit and the pilot had to make an emergency landing in the rainforest. The helicopter was flying very low because the pilot was not instrument rated. The skid hit the water followed by the tail rotor and the helicopter crashed. The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from the surface of an open body of water while intentionally attempting to maintain a very low altitude while in cruise flight. Factors include falling snow, low ceilings, whiteout/greyout conditions, and flat/glassy water. Three minutes after taking off and while in a climbing left turn, at 2,800 ft., parts of the plane, including the vertical stabilizer and rudder, fell from the aircraft. The crew soon lost control of the plane which nose dived and crashed into a residential neighborhood. After flying into the wake turbulence of two aircraft about two minutes into the flight, investigators believe a series of quick rudder swings by the copilot whipped the tail so severely that the fin broke off. The National Transportation Safety Board has found that pilot error was the probable cause. Sharply criticizing American Airlines Advanced Aircraft Maneuvering Program, the Board said that American Airlines' pilot training included a simulator exercise which could have caused the first officer to have an unrealistiand exaggerated view of the effects of wake turbulence, erroneously associate wake turbulence encounters with the need for aggressive roll upset recovery techniques and develop control strategies that would produce a much different -- and potentially surprising and confusing -- response if performed during flight. In addition, because of its high sensitivity, the Airbus A-300-600 rudder control system is susceptible to potentially hazardous rudder pedal inputs at higher airspeed. Residents heard a loud noise and saw flames in the night sky as the aircraft clipped treetops and summer homes before crashing into a snowy forest. Wreckage was spread over a 1.5 mile area. Serious maintenance violations and operational procedures were discovered during the investigation of the accident. The cargo plane was not able to gain altitude, veered off the runway and crashed. The (undetermined) pilot-at-the-controls' early, and over rotation of the airplane's nose during the takeoff attempt, and his failure to maintain directional control. Also causal, was the captain's inadequate remedial action, both during the takeoff attempt and after the airplane departed the runway. The plane crashed into a marshy forested area about 2 kilometer short of its destination at Kardla Airport. Several errors by the pilot. The aircraft was flying through a mix of rain and snow on final approach, when it crashed in a wooded area, 5.5 miles from Zurich Airport where it was scheduled to land on Runway 28.  At 22.03 the aircraft was descending to 4000 ft. on final approach.  At 22.05 the captain reported reaching the minimum descent altitude and stated he could see the ground. Shortly after, the radio altimeter reported 500 ft. agl, followed by a 'minimum' warning. A go-around was ordered, but it was too late and the aircraft struck trees and crashed. American pop singer, Melanie Thornton, 34, killed. Maria Serano Serano and Nathaly van het Ende both 27, and members of the pop-musitrio, Passion Fruit, also killed. The pilot had been working more than 13 hours when the accident took place and had also exceeded maximum duty several times in the days preceding the crash. The cargo plane contacted the ground 700 meters short of the runway, broke in two and burned. The plane crashed into Chontal Hill in the Tarrazú mountain range, 5 minutes before it was scheduled arrival at Quepos. The aircraft was flying IFR, in clouds, when it crashed into trees and broke apart. The plane was off to the left of its intended flight path. A fire broke out aboard the aircraft while en route at FL290. The crew was preparing for an emergency landing when two explosions tore apart the plane causing it to crash. The cargo plane crashed into high ground less than 5 miles from the airport while on an ILS approach. The poor in-flight planning by the pilot-in-command for his initiation of the ILS approach to runway 05 with weather conditions below minimums for the approach contrary to the Federal Aviation Regulations, and the failure of the pilot to maintain control of the airplane during a missed approach resulting in the in-flight collision with trees then terrain. While enroute the cargo plane on a positioning flight entered an uncontroled descent and crashed. Loss of control during descent for undetermined reasons. The plane may have been shot down by Allied DemocratiForces rebels. The aircraft crashed into El Silencio de El manzanillo mountain at 7,800 ft., 3 minutes after taking off in heavy rain and poor visibility from Medellin Airport. After reaching a height of 500 ft. the aircraft began to loose altitude until the plane impacted the ground at the end of Runway 34. The crew lost spatial orientation after take-off, leading to an unintentional loss of altitude. The copilot's basitraining in instrument flying did not include night instrument take-offs. The crew's method of working was adversely affected by great time pressure. Executing the take-off as a rolling take-off was not adapted to the prevailing meteorological conditions. The aircraft crashed into the Weser River shortly after taking off from Bremerhaven Airport. Three persons were pulled from the river, two of whom died shortly thereafter as a result of their injuries. The pilot declared an emergency and ditched into AtlantiOcean, 300 yards off Dania Beach in 15 feet of water. The pilot's inadequate planning for a Title 14 CFR Part 135 on-demand air taxi flight, and his failure to refuel the airplane, which resulted in fuel exhaustion while en route over the AtlantiOcean, a power off glide, and ditching in the ocean. After taking off, banked to the left, wing contacted ground, a fire erupted and the aircraft broke up. Failure of the crew to de-ice the wings before takeoff. Possible impairment of crew performance by the combined effects of a non-prescription drug, jet-lag and fatigue were also considered factors. While on approach the aircraft struck a hill a few hundred feet short of runway in poor weather. While descending, the cargo plane struck Mount Santa Maria Vieja, 35 km from the airport in fog and poor visibility. During a landing attempt at Chilpancingo, the aircraft left the runway, struck a concrete perimeter wall, overturned and burned. The government plane belonged to the General Office of the judge advocate. The aircraft suffered a flame out of both engines in torrential rains while on approach  to Yogyakarta. The crew made an emergency landing in the Bengawan Solo River, in shallow water. The plane circled several times before diving in a steep course towards the river. The plane's left wing struck a river bank before it plunged into the water. A flight attendant drowned in the shallow water when she jumped from the plane. The plane crashed into del cerro El Tigre mountain in the jungles of the Amazon at an elevation of 14,700 ft.  The 35 minute flight was transporting oil workers to a remote oil field. The sightseeing plane hit a mountainside at  an elevation of 4,500 ft.,  200 ft. below the summit. The weather was clear at the time of the accident. Crashed 2km short of the runway  from the Luena Airport while attempting to land in heavy rain. The airliner crashed into the fogbound 15,721 ft. Nevado de Cumbal volcano, in the Andes mountains, near the Ecuador / Colombian border. Air trafficontrol lost contact with the plane as it circled into Colombian territory to maneuver around snow capped mountain peaks and return to the Ecuadorian border city of Tulcán. While practicing touch-and-goes the aircraft made  a sharp turn to the left which continued until the aircraft turned over and crashed. Crashed against the side of a mountain in heavy fog in the Sefid Kouh mountain range while on approach to Khorramabad. The plane was totally destroyed and scattered in small pieces across the mountain. Pilot error. The cargo plane crashed while attempting to make an emergency landing. The plane was making an emergency landing after two previous attempts in heavy snow and strong winds when it clipped treetops and crashed into a field, approximately 1.5km short of the runway. A helicopter ferrying U.S. troops in a counter-terrorism exercise, crashed into the sea, 30 minutes before its scheduled arrival at Mactan Island. The helicopter was flying in tandem with another U.S. Army Chinook when it crashed. While en route the cargo plane impacted the side of a mountain at an altitude of 6,167 ft.  Pilot error. The crew did not conform to the VFR that required a track change to maintain the required flight parameters and/or a diversion to a suitable alternate airport. While en-route, 35 minutes into the flight, the bi-plane crashed near Santa Clara. The plane was seen spinning out of control before it hit the ground. A strong gust of wind, possibly a small tornado, tore off the top part of the left wing. After encountering icing, the pilot of the cargo plane decided to divert to the nearest airport but continued to lose altitude until he crashed into trees. The pilot not removing the ice contamination from the airplane prior to departure and the pilot intentionally flying into known severe icing conditions, resulting in the aircraft not being able to maintain altitude/clearance from the terrain. Factors to the accident included the icing conditions and the trees encountered during the forced landing. The cargo plane crashed into the ocean while on approach to Runway 27. Crashed into low terrain while en route. Why the pilot continued flight into marginal weather conditions at an altitude that was insufficient to ensure terrain clearance, could not be established. The cargo plane crashed into lights near the runway threshold while attempting to land on Runway 24L. The aircraft crashed onto a mountain, in fog, wind and rain while attempting to land at Kimhae Airport. A strong southerly wind required the aircraft to make a turn and approach the runway from the north. The aircraft crashed near the peak of Mt. Mulbong, approximately 3 mile north of the runway. The plane bounced three times before hitting the ground and exploding. More than 1,000 trees were uprooted by the impact. The plane was off course when the crew turned on final. Operational errors by the crew. Lack of pilot experience in landing in adverse weather conditions. First Air China fatal accident. Crashed while en route. The pilot's limited experience in instrument flight conditions may have been insufficient to prevent a loss of aircraft control when he inadvertently entered an area of low visibility in the Sweers Island area. The plane was being used by the Penitentiary and Prison National Institute, Inpec, to fly prisoners from Medellín to Popayán. The aircraft had just finished flying 50 prisoners to Popayán when it took off from Popayán to pick up more prisoners. The aircraft nosed into the ground shortly after becoming airborne. The aircraft crashed in the El Urracal mountains, 12 miles from the runway were it took off at El Aguacate Air Force base. The wreckage of the airplane was in a box canyon on the east side of the 45-degree sloping terrain at an elevation of 3,500 feet. Those aboard were surveying the Patruca jungle on a conservation project. Among those killed were three mayors from cities in the region. Observers on the ground reported the plane was on fire before it crashed. The helicopter struck power lines and crashed in near-zero visibility. Governor of Krasnoyarsk territory, Alexander Lebed, 52, was among those killed. 'Power line, power line!' were the last words of the pilot. Thick fog concealing a frost-covered power line led to the helicopter crash. The aircraft crashed into houses, two mosques and a school in the densely populated neighborhood of Gwammaja, approximately  1.2 miles from Kano International Airport, shortly after taking off. There were reports of an engine failure and  fire during the takeoff. The jet airliner crashed into a hillside, 4 miles from the Tunis-Carthage airport, as the pilot attempted to make a landing. The plane's landing gear had failed to open during the approach into Tunis-Carthage airport and the pilot had made another circuit before attempting a fresh landing when the plane crashed in heavy rain and high winds. The accident was attributed to the rough weather conditions and the pilot's inability to deal with the situation. The MD-82 crashed into the Dalian Bay, 12 miles east of Dalian airport. The pilot reported a fire aboard the aircraft and the cabin lights were out prior to the plane impacting the water.  The accident was caused by an act of sabotage by a passenger who lit a fire in the cabin. He had bought multiple insurance policies before boarding the flight. The plane crashed approximately 12 miles from Calabar while attempting to land. All passengers departed at Port Harcourt and only a crew of 5 was aboard. The premature departure of the plane from the normal minimum safe altitude of 2,500 ft. without air trafficontroller's clearance until it flew into the terrain. Other contributing factors were the emergence of electrical problem on the aircraft at the commencement of the approach which might have distracted the  pilot  and unfavorable weather conditions of low ceiling and thunderstorms which impaired visibility at the critical time of descent. The flight crashed into the sea, 31 miles NE of the Penghu (Pescadore) Islands in the Taiwan Strait. The plane disappeared from radar while flying at 35,000 ft. approximately 20 minutes after taking off from Chiang Kai Shek Airport. There was no distress call and the weather was good at the time. Military radar revealed the aircraft  disintegrated in midair, breaking into four pieces. Only 175 of 225 bodies were recovered. The carrier  failed to conduct a preventive anti-rust operation in a timely manner every four years. Damage from a 1980 tailstrike was not properly repaired and fatigue cracks formed, which eventually led to a structural failure. The aircraft crashed in thunderstorms and heavy rain while en route. The private postal service plane crashed into the Outeniqua mountains, near Outeniqua Pass, after a missed approach to George Airport. The aircraft crashed as it circled for another landing attempting poor weather conditions. Former South African cricket captain, Hansie Cronje, 32, the only passenger aboard, was killed along with the crew. Pilot error.

The plane tookoff and encountered heavy clouds all along the route.  Wreckage was found 42 miles from Oiapoque, in an Amazon forest. Poor weather conditions. While on a second approach, the pilot radioed a mayday saying that both his engines had failed.  The aircraft landed at an intersection striking a vehicle. Fuel starvation. While participating in a night mission to remove U.S. Special Forces troops the plane crashed 2.5 miles from the airstrip. Overloaded. The excessive cargo weight loaded on the aircraft at the Band E Sardeh Dam landing zone. The airliner and cargo plane collided over southern Germany at 35,400 ft. Debris was spread across a 20 mile radius. Fifty-two children on a beach holiday were among the 69 aboard the Tupolev. The Tupolev pilot received contradictory instructions. The collision avoidance warning system (TCAS) told the pilot to ascend followed by an order from the Swiss air trafficontroller to descend one second later. The Russian plane did not immediately respond to the tower's order to descend, so he repeated the command 14 seconds later. Thirty seconds later the two planes collided. The Tupolev's TCAS was telling the pilots to ascend. The Boeing's TCAS was telling the pilots to descend. The Swiss air trafficontroller was telling the Tupolev's pilots to descend. The air trafficontroller that guided the planes had no way of knowing the Russian pilot was receiving contradictory instruction from his cockpit TCAS unless told so by the pilot. Russian aviation officials said the pilot correctly gave precedence to the control tower, but Western aviation experts said pilots are trained to give precedence to the cockpit warning. In addition, the controller was left alone on duty while his partner went on a break and was preoccupied with another aircraft. This was accepted policy at Skyguide, the Swiss air control company. In addition, maintenance crews, working on the computer system, limited the controller's information he was receiving including conflict alert warnings. Sadly, one-and-a-half years later, the controller, Peter Nielsen, was stabbed to death by a Russian man who had lost his wife and two children in the accident. The aircraft lost power while taking off from Bracket Airport and crashed into picnickers on the shoreline of Puddingstone Lake in Bonelli Park. The plane was observed in a left bank, traveling approximately 30 feet above and parallel to the shoreline, before impacting two trees in a picniarea. Witnesses reported that they did not hear the engines running. The pilot made 3 consecutive mayday calls during the initial climb-out from runway 26L, however, the pilot did not indicate the nature of the emergency.  Two children on the ground were killed. Fifteen others were injured. The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed which resulted in an inadvertent stall, and subsequent collision with terrain. A contributing factor was the pilot's impairment from the effects of prescription painkilling drugs. The aircraft crashed 2 miles short of the runway into the Guitangola neighborhood of Bangui. The plane was bound for Brazzaville but diverted to Bangui because of mechanical problems. Two survived but succumbed to their injuries. The commercial pilot of the float-equipped airplane was transporting passengers to a lodge at a remote lake. When the airplane did not arrive at the lake, a search was initiated, and two days later the wreckage of the airplane was located on the side of a box canyon about the 2,400 foot elevation level. The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from terrain while maneuvering inside a box/blind canyon, resulting in an in-flight collision with terrain. A factor contributing to the accident was the box/blind canyon. Air trafficontrol lost contact with the aircraft 15 minutes before it was scheduled to land. The wreckage was found atop a 5,300 ft. mountain, surrounded by thick jungle, 5 miles from its destination. The helicopter was ferrying workers from a gas rig to a oil platform in the North Sea when it crashed into the water at high speed, 28 miles northeast of Cromer. The helicopter was at a height of 320 ft. flying in a south-easterly heading when one of the rotor blades failed.  The accident was caused by a broken rotor blade, caused by fatigue, brought about by a lightning strike three years earlier. The aircraft hit a tree and crashed into a hill, 6 miles north of Surkhet in poor weather conditions. Wreckage was strewn over a wide area. The Su-76 was performing aerobatics when it crashed into crowd of spectators at an air show at Skniliv Airport in the Ukraine. The aircraft had just performed a steep turn when it appeared to tumble and enter a steep dive from which it failed to recover. The two pilots parachuted to safety.  Pilot error. The pilots ignored their flight plans and performed untried and complicated maneuvers which led to a loss of control. Both received a jail sentence of 14 years. A Russian passenger airliner on a training flight crashed shortly after takeoff from Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport. After reaching an altitude of about 600 ft., the plane banked hard left, hit the ground and exploded. Sixteen of 18 crewmembers aboard were killed. Two flight attendants survived. Investigation revealed that the stabilizer spontaneously shifted to the full down position two seconds after takeoff. Six seconds after the shift, the captain tried to compensate by thrusting the control stick forward as far as possible, but was unable to regain control of the aircraft. The military plane crashed into a mountain top, approximately 10 miles south of San Juan, Puerto Rico, in rough terrain, while performing low-level training exercises. Witnesses reported the aircraft was flying low and hit some trees before crashing into a ravine, bursting into flames and disintegrating. There was rain and fog at the time of the accident. The military plane developed engine trouble while en route, tried to return to the airport but crashed into a paddy field and was destroyed. The Russian transport helicopter, carrying troops, crashed at Russian military headquarter near the capital city of Grozny. Reporting an engine fire, the pilot attempted to make an emergency landing when the helicopter fell from a height of 660 feet and missed the tarmaby 990 feet, crashed and caught fire.  The helicopter was shot down by Chechen guerillas with a shoulder-launched heat-seeking anti-aircraft missile. The missile destroyed the helicopter's right engine and starting a fire on board. The left engine stopped at the same time. The entire hydraulicontrol system, including the system used to open the rear door was not working, as burning fuel gushed into the cabin trapping people inside. This is the worst helicopter disaster in aviation history. The plane crashed into a hill 3 miles southeast of Pokhara Airport while on approach. The plane broke into several pieces and bodies and wreckage was scattered over a small area. There was poor weather in the area at the time of the accident. The twin prop plane crashed into a cliff in dense fog as it prepared to land at Ayan. ATC lost contact with the aircraft 12 minutes before it was scheduled to land.  The crew made four attempts to land before disappearing off radar. While attempting to land the air ambulance, the thrust reverser deployed lights did not illuminate, so the captain stowed the thrust reverse levers and activated them again with the same result. The captain then released and reapplied the brakes with no effect. The airplane then overran the runway and the right wing struck the ILS antennas and lighting. The plane came to rest and burst into flames. The captain's addition of forward thrust during the landing rollout, which resulted in a lack of braking effectiveness and a subsequent runway overrun. A factor was the captain's inability to deploy the thrust reversers for undetermined reasons. The plane crashed about 1 mile short of the runway in heavy rain and strong winds while attempting to land at Rio Branco Airport. Congressman Ildefonso Cordeiro was among the victims. The survey flight to check out the ILS on Runway 36 the plane circled for another approach and collided with a slope of a mountain at an altitude off 2,500 meters which was shrouded in clouds. Crashed into a densly wooded area 7nm from its destination. For undetermined reasons, the aircraft descended below the minimum safe altitude as prescribed on the NDB 25 approach for High Prairie and struck the terrain. Shortly after taking off, the pilot radioed a distress call saying he was losing altitude and was returning to the airport. Shortly thereafter, the plane crashed in a wooded area. One hour after the takeoff , the the plane  disappeared of  Curitiba  ATC. The wreckage was found on a farm, around a crater. Unknown cause. The hunting charter crashed inverted in a forest while attempting to land at Agunish River. Because of the geographiand weather conditions, the pilot probably had trouble judging his horizontal and vertical distance with respect to the mountain, and the aircraft crashed. The two Navy aircraft flying in formation in a military flyby, crashed, after their wings collided. One plane crashed into a house under construction while the other crashed onto a field next to a highway. Six crew members on each plane were killed along with 5 on the ground. The crew was not able to stop the plane on the rain-slick runway, overran the runway and collided with an obstacle. While en route the pilot of the cargo plane radioed was in an uncontrolled descent. The plane impacted the water in Big Bateau Bay. The pilot's spatial disorientation, which resulted in loss of airplane control. Contributing to the accident was the night instrument meteorological conditions with variable cloud layers The private charter flight crashed and burned in a wooded area 2 miles from Eveleth-Virginia Municipal Airport where it was scheduled to land. Weather was visibility 2 miles in freezing rain. Light snow and light fog. Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone, 58, killed, along with his wife, daughter, three staff members and a crew of two. During the later stages of the approach, the flight crew failed to monitor the airplane's airspeed and allowed it to decrease to a dangerously low level and to remain below the recommended approach airspeed for about 50 seconds. The flight crew failed to recognize that a stall was imminent and allowed the airplane to enter a stall from which they did not recover. The  inadequate  airspeed  or  the  full  course deviation indicator needle deflection should have prompted the flight crew to execute a go-around; however, they failed to do so. The plane crashed 6 miles short of the runway at Findel Airport while attempting to land in heavy fog.  Indications are that the aircraft lost all power in both engines before crashing and catching fire. Two minutes after taking off, the aircraft went down in a swamp, about 1 mile from Juwata airport. The pilot radioed he was returning to the airport because of an engine failure. While on a positioning flight the plane entered an uncontrolled descent and crashed. The pilot's inadvertent flight into mountain wave weather conditions while IMC, resulting in a loss of aircraft control. The plane experienced failure of the left engine shortly after taking off from Ninoy Aquino airport. The pilot declared and emergency and the aircraft ditched into Manila Bay and breaking up about one-half mile offshore. Fuel starvation.

Visibility was less than 200 feet. The commuter plane was not able to maintain altitude after taking off from Charlotte-Douglas International Airport and crashed into the side of a hanger and burst into flames. The weather was clear, cold and windy, with greater than 10 miles visibility at the time of the accident. The airplane's loss of pitch control during takeoff was the result of incorrect rigging of the elevator control system compounded by the airplane's center of gravity, which was substantially aft of the certified aft limit. Contributing to the cause of the accident was: (1) Air Midwest's lack of oversight of the work being performed at the Huntington, West Virginia, maintenance station, (2) Air Midwest's maintenance procedures and documentation, (3) Air Midwest's weight and balance program at the time of the accident, (4) the Raytheon Aerospace quality assurance inspector's failure to detect the incorrect rigging of the elevator system, (5) the FAA's average weight assumptions in its weight and balance program guidance at the time of the accident and (6) the FAA's lack of oversight of Air Midwest's maintenance program and its weight and balance program. The aircraft crashed into 11,500 ft. Coloque mountain at an altitude of 7,550 ft., about 30 minutes after leaving Chiclayo and three minutes from landing at Chachapoyas.

The plane crashed into a mountainside in a remote region near the town of Kohat, about 250 kilometers northwest of Islamabad. Among those killed was Air Force chief Mushaf Ali Mir.  Pilot error. Pilot's premature descent below minima which resulted in the aircraft hitting a cloud covered ridge at 3,000 feet above sea level. While carrying a group of parachute jumpers, the aircraft began to disintegrate in mid-air while flying at an altitude of about 10,000 ft. The tail and left wing separated from the plane before it crashed into an area of deep snow. Many of the skydivers were able to jump out of the plane to safely before it crashed. The starboard engine caught fire and failed while the plane was attempting to take off. The aircraft continued about 2,000 ft. past the end of the runway and crashed. The accident was caused by the loss of an engine during a critical phase of flight, the non-retraction of the landing gear after the engine failure, and the Captain, the pilot not flying, taking over control of the airplane before having clearly identified the problem. Crashed into a 7,000 ft. mountain three minutes after after taking off. The aircraft, owned by a flying club as a rental airplane, was destroyed following an uncontrolled descent into terrain about 2 miles west of New Vienna, Iowa. The improper planning/decision by the pilot to fly into forecast icing  conditions with an airplane not equipped with a certified deicing system. Also casual to the accident was the continued flight in known icing conditions and the pilot not performing flight to an alternate destination. A contributing factor was the pilot's lack of qualification as an air carrier. A large number of military personnel and their family members were sucked out of the plane after the aircraft's back ramp accidentally dropped open in flight. The ramp opened as the pressure system broke down. The crew managed to control the plane and turn it around and land at Kinshasa airport following the accident, which took place 45 minutes into the flight. There is a wide discrepancy in the number killed ranging from 0 to 250. The plane struck the side of a steep mountain in heavy fog on its third attempt to land at Trabzon to refuel.

The airplane was destroyed during a collision with snow-covered glacial terrain following a loss of control during cruise flight, about 40 miles north-northwest of Talkeetna, Alaska. The airplane was being operated as a visual flight rules. The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed which resulted in an inadvertent stall, an uncontrolled descent and in-flight collision with terrain. A factor associated with the accident was rising terrain Shortly after taking off the jet nosed into the ground. Malfunction of the trim tab system. Forty miles into it flight the aircraft crashed into the Amazon forest. The aircraft was not certified for IFR flight. Heavy cloud cover existed along the flight route. The aircraft crashed short of the runway in fog while on approach to Christchurch Airport. The plane crashed two kilometers from the airport, hitting a farm hedge and sliding across a paddock before smashing into a row of trees. After takeoff, the pilot reported low pressure of oil  in an engine and  decided to return to the airport. The plane made a 270 degree turn in the final approach, stalled  and crashed to the ground. The helicopter impacted a lava field on the Pulama Pali in the Volcanoes National Park, Volcano, Hawaii.  A loss of engine power due to the fatigue fracture and separation of the compressor coupling adapter. The fatigue fracture was initiated by fretting on the pilot diameter due to both the inadequate design of the coupling and the coaxial misalignment of the spur adapter gear, compressor-coupling adapter, and compressor impeller during recent engine maintenance where the gearbox was removed and replaced. A factor in the accident was the unsuitable nature of the terrain to make an emergency landing. The aircraft crashed onto a road and caught fire 1 km from Brest-Guipavas Airport in France's Brittany region, killing the pilot and injuring three others. There were thunderstorms in the area with 800 meters visibility at the time the accident took place. Nose dived into the ground shortly after takeoff near the Shur River. The airlpane is presumed to have collided with the ocean waters of the Cook Inlet, about 7 miles southwest of Anchor Point, Alaska. No wreckage has been located, and the airplane is presumed to be destroyed. A fatally injured passenger was located on July 3, in ocean waters near Anchor Point. An in-flight collision with water for an undetermined reason. Shortly after taking off the air ambulance hit a hill side in the Gamsberg Mountains. The military plane crashed into houses in the Beni Mered neighborhood, west of the Algerian capital, shortly after takeoff from the Boufarik military airport, 25 miles southwest of the capital. Witnesses reported seeing an engine on fire prior to the crash. The plane crashed on final approach to Belem Airport during a strong  thunderstorm. The helicopter  was landing on the helideck of the ship Toisa Mariner, when the tail rotor collided with the flagpole on the ship. The pilot lost the control and the helicopter crashed into the  sea. The plane's crew reported technical difficulties (engine failure) 10 minutes after taking off from Port Sudan Airport. The plane crashed into a hillside, 3 miles from the airport as the crew tried to return and make emergency landing. A three-year-old boy was the only survivor. Twenty miles west of its destination, at an altitude of 3,500 ft., the right engine began coming apart and throwing parts out of the cowling. Although the right engine was feathered, flaps and gear retracted and full power applied t the left engine, the plane could not maintain altitude and the pilot ditched the aircraft 15 miles from its destination. All passengers and the pilot were able to exit from the plane before it sank but 2 passengers subsequently died. The in-flight failure of the right engine and the pilot's failure to adequately manage the airplane's performance after the engine failed. The right engine failure resulted for inadequate maintenance that was performed by Air Sunshine's maintenance personnel during undocumented maintenance. Contributing to the passenger fatalities was the pilot's failure to provide an emergency briefing after the right engine failed. Crashed atop a hill in Chorro del Indio National Park during a descent to San Cristobal. The plane crashed into the eastern slopes of Mount Kenya at an altitude of 16,355 feet as it attempted to fly around Lenana Peak and land in Samburu National Park. Ten American tourists and 2 pilots were killed when the plane hit the mountain 450 feet below the snow covered peak and disintegrated upon impact. Poor visibility may have been a factor. The helilcopter collided with terrain while maneuvering in the Waialeale Crater, Kauai, Hawaii. The helicopter impacted steep upsloping terrain on the northwestern inside crater wall and was destroyed. The pilot's failure to maintain adequate terrain clearance/altitude while descending over mountainous terrain, and his continued flight into adverse weather. Factors contributing to the accident were clouds and a low ceiling. During a positioning flight the jet crashed into several houses before ending up in a river.

On a night repositioning flight, while en route, the stick shaker activated several times before the plane entered a aerodynamistall. Almost simultaneously both engines stopped. The crew declared an emergency but the plane did not make the airport, crashed and broke up. PC:  The pilots' unprofessional behavior, deviation from standard operating procedures, and poor airmanship, which resulted in an in-flight emergency from which they were unable to recover, in part because of the pilots' inadequate training The pilots' failure to prepare for an emergency landing in a timely manner, including communicating with air trafficontrollers immediately after the emergency about the loss of both engines and the availability of landing sites and the pilots' failure to achieve and maintain the target airspeed in the double engine failure checklist, which caused the engine cores to stop rotating and resulted in the core lock engine condition. Contributing to this accident was the engine core lock condition, which prevented at least one engine from being restarted, and the airplane flight manuals that did not communicate to pilots the importance of maintaining a minimum airspeed to keep the engine cores rotating. The cargo plane did not gain altitude and ran off the end of the runway and crashed into a forest. The aircraft's lower aft fuselage struck a berm supporting a localizer antenna, resulting in the tail separating from the aircraft, rendering the aircraft uncontrollable. The incorrect V speeds and thrust setting were too low to enable the aircraft to take off safely for the actual weight of the aircraft. The pilots of MKA1602 did not carry out the gross error check in accordance with the company's standard operating procedures (SOPs), and the incorrect take-off performance data were not detected. Crew fatigue. During descent in poor weather, the cargo plane struck a mountain near the airport. A few minutes after takeoff, the cargo plane struck the side Tagbao mountain a few  kilometers from the airport. The turboprop crashed 4 miles south of Kirksville while on approach to Kirksville Municipal Airport. The plane clipped tree tops before crashing on its belly into a wooded area. Data show the plane descending then climbing slightly in the last four seconds before impact. The plane lacked a modern terrain warning system which would have been required equipment the next year. The pilots' failure to follow established procedures and properly conduct a nonprecision instrument approach at night in instrument meteorological conditions, including their descent below the minimum descent altitude before required visual cues were available (which continued unmoderated until the airplane struck the trees) and their failure to adhere to the established division of duties between the flying and nonflying pilots. Contributing to the accident were the pilots' failure to make standard callouts and the current Federal Aviation Regulations that allow pilots to descend below the MDA into a region in which safe obstacle clearance is not assured based upon seeing the airport approach lights. The pilots' failure to establish and maintain a professional demeanor during the flight and their fatigue likely contributed to their degraded performance.

Two minutes after taking off, the air ambulance crashed into Otay peak,  in an isolated area of mountains, 8 miles east of Brown Field Municipal Airport. Dark night visual conditions prevailed. The controller's Minimum Safe Altitude Warning System issued and alert during the last two radar returns. The air trafficontroller failed to alert the crew to altitude warnings as the plane was on track to fly into a mountain. The controller identified the airplane on the radar screen and instructed crew members to expect clearance above 5,000 feet, but then issued a heading that resulted in a flight track directly into the mountains. The mountain is at 3,556 feet altitude. Also, the flight crew did not follow the recommended departure procedures for taking off at night and in mountainous terrain. Failure of the flightcrew to maintain terrain clearance during a VFR departure, which resulted in controlled flight into terrain, and the air trafficontroller's issuance of a clearance that transferred the responsibility for terrain clearance from the fllightcrew to the controller. The controller's failure to provide terrain clearance instructions to the flightcrew, and failure to advise the flightcrew of minimum safe altitude warning alerts. Contributing to the accident was the pilots' fatigue which likely contributed to their degraded decision making.

Weather at the time of the accident was poor, with low ceiling and torrential rain. The aircraft crashed into a frozen lake in Nanhai Park, 10 seconds after taking off. Ice pollution of the wings of the aircraft led to the accident. Failure to deice the plane. While attempting to take off from R31, the aircraft skidded sideways off the runway and went through a perimeter fence, ripping the cockpit from the fuselage and bursting into flames. There was light snow falling with fog and reduced visibility at the time of the accident.  Also, the pilot chose to take off from a 7,500 ft. runway rather than wait for the 10,000 ft. runway to be plowed. The youngest son of NBC sports chairman Dick Ebersol and actress Susan Saint James killed. St. James had just exited the accident vehicle before it took off. The flightcrew's failure to ensure that the airplane's wings were free of ice or snow contamination that accumulated while the airplane was on the ground, which resulted in an attempted takeoff with upper wing contamination that induced the a subsequent stall and collision with the ground. A factor contributing to the accident was the pilots' lack of experience flying during winter weather conditions. While attempting to land, the plane overran the runway and crashed through the airport barrier fence, into a rice field, broke in two and  came to rest at a cemetery, 300 meters beyond the runway. Bad weather and a malfunctioning spoiler may have caused the crash. Shortly after taking off the plane lost altitude and crashed on Howell Island a few miles from the airport. The maintenance facility failed to properly install and inspect the elevator trim system resulting in the reversed elevator trim condition and the pilot's failure to maintain clearance with the terrain. Contributing factors included the dark night and low ceiling. The aircraft crashed and burned while on approach to Runway 31 at Friedman Memorial Airport. The pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control while on approach for landing in icing conditions. Inadequate airspeed was a factor. Destroyed upon impact with terrain.

While on approach the business flight descended through IMC until the left wing contacted the ground. The plane crashed into a field and burned. The plane crashed because the pilots failed to notice the airplane had slowed to an unsafe speed and allowed the plane to stall. In addition, there was a thin layer of ice on the aircraft's wings. The flight crew's failure to effectively monitor and maintain airspeed and comply with procedures for deice boot activation on the approach, which caused an aerodynamistall from which they did not recover. Contributing to the accident was the FAA's failure to establish adequate certification requirements for flight into icing conditions, which led to the inadequate stall warning margin provided by the airplane's stall warning system. While on approach to Runway 29 the aircraft crashed on a mountain. On final approach, the aircraft crashed into the sea 100 meters off shore, 400 meters short of runway. The cargo plane crashed into a wooded area short of the runway and was destroyed. While on final approach, the air ambulance crashed into the sea at night and in poor visibility.

The airliner disappeared from radar and crashed into dense jungle shortly after taking off from Malabala. A witness saw flames coming from the side of the plane shortly after take-off. The plane then tilted and fell, skidded over trees for a distance of about half a mile and crashed. The plane was overloaded. The aircraft was built to accommodate a maximum of 48 passengers. The plane landed almost half-way down Runway 24, overran the runway, broke in two and caught fire. There was severe thunderstorms at the time of the landing with rain, lightning and hail. All 309 aboard escaped. There were 43 injuries. The pilot landed the plane too far down the rain-slick runway making it virtually impossible to stop the plane before it ran off the runway. In addition, the reverse thrust was not employed until 17 seconds after the wheels touched down. The aircraft developed engine trouble while en route from Bari Italy to Djerba, Tunisia The crew contacted Palermo ATC for an emergency landing but ditched into the sea approximately 19 miles north of Palermo. The pilot reported that both engines had failed. Fuel starvation. The maintenance crew incorrectly installed a fuel gauge for a ATR-42 on the ATR-72. Both instruments look very similar.

While flying at FL340 towards Athens the crew reported problems with their air conditioning system. As the airliner entered Greek airspace ATC lost contact with the plane. Two Greek F-16 fighters were dispatched to intercept the plane. The F-16 pilots reported that one pilot was not in the cockpit and the other was slumped over the controls. They also said oxygen masks had deployed in the cabin. The plane continued on its programmed route to a holding pattern off the coast of Greece and flew in circles for two hours. Meanwhile, at least two flight attendants had stayed awake using portable oxygen bottles but they couldn't get through the locked, terrorist-proof cockpit door. It was only when one engine failed from fuel starvation that the computer-controlled systems aboard the plane unlocked the door. The plane continued on track until it crashed into mountainous terrain about 25 miles north of Athens. CVR tapes showed that a student pilot/flight attendant, Andreas Prodromos, was at the controls of the aircraft and tried to send a Mayday message twice but the radio was set to the wrong frequency. The cabin pressure control was left in the manual, instead of auto position by maintenance workers. The error was not picked up by the two pilots during three subsequent check lists. They failed to respond to warnings as oxygen masks fell in the passenger cabin which eventually  led to the two pilots losing consciousness and the plane crashing. While en route, the crew reported engine trouble with both engines and planed to divert to Caracas. The plane began losing altitude and eventually crashed in the Sierra de Perija mountains on the Columbian-Venezuelan border. The autopilot might have reduced engine power too much after a rapid climb to FL330, allowing airspeed to bleed off to the point of a stall. Also the data recorder showed that rather than push the nose over to recover from the stall, the pilots held the yoke to their chests all the way to the ground. The plane was about to land at Pucallpa when it ran into strong winds from a tropical storm. The pilot tried to make an emergency landing without its landing gear on a road near the jungle airport. The plane crashed, broke up and caught fire about 2 miles from the airport. While on approach to Runway 31 the plane hit trees, crashed and burned. Seconds after taking off the jetliner shook violently, veered to the left and crashed into a residential neighborhood 500 yards past the end of the runway.

The aircraft, on a positioning flight,  crashed in a wooded area shortly after taking off. Crashed into Mount Morrocoy, 5 miles from the airport shortly after taking off. Wreckage found two days later. After avoiding another helicopter, the helicopter headed into a heavy rainstorm. After entering a turn the airspeed dropped to zero and the helicopter descended rapidly until it hit the water bounced and hit the water again. The pilot's decision to continue flight into adverse weather conditions, which resulted in a loss of control due to an encounter with a microburst. Contributing to the accident was inadequate FAA surveillance of Special Federal Aviation Regulation 71 operating restrictions. Contributing to the loss of life in the accident was the lack of helicopter flotation equipment. The aircraft carrying troops made a hard landing causing the landing gear to penetrate the fuselage. Two passengers were killed when they exited the plane and ran into the propellers which were still turning. Soon after taking off the plane encountered icing conditions and the pilot tried to return to the airport but did not make it crashing into a Canadian National main railway track. In-flight icing conditions in which the aircraft's performance deteriorated until the aircraft was unable to maintain altitude. Also, the aircraft was overloaded by 288 pounds for normal weather conditions, 488 if there was icing. The tower lost sight and contact with the plane about five minutes after taking off from Murtala Muhammad International  airport. The plane crashed about 30 miles north of Lagos.  A storm was passing through the airport at about the time the aircraft took off. While descending for a landing at Domodedovo Airport in a snowstorm, the aircraft crashed into a forest 6 miles northeast of Stupino. Icing conditions were reported at the time of the accident. The military plane crashed into an apartment building in the Azari district after taking off from Mehrabad Airport. The plane suffered engine failure and was attempting to return for a emergency landing. The jetliner slid off Runway 13C at Chicago's Midway Airport, went through an airport boundary fence and crashed into two vehicles at a nearby intersection, killing a young 6- year-old boy. Heavy snow was falling at the time of the accident. The plane had circled the airport for 30 to 35 minutes before attempting to land. The pilots' failure to use available reverse thrust in a timely manner to safely slow or stop the airplane after landing, which resulted in a runway overrun. This failure occurred because the pilots' first experience and lack of familiarity with the airplane's autobrake system distracted them from thrust reverser usage during the challenging landing. Contributing to the accident were Southwest Airline's 1) failure to provide its pilots with clear and consistent guidance and training regarding company policies and procedures related to arrival landing distance calculations; 2) programming and design of its onboard performance computer, which did not present inherent assumptions in the program critical to pilot decision making; 3) plan to implement new autobrake procedures without a familiarization period; and 4) failure to include a margin of safety in the arrival assessment to account for operational uncertainties. Also contributing to the accident was the pilots' failure to divert to another airport given reports that included poor braking action and a tailwind component greater than 5 knots. Contributing to the severity of the accident was the absence of an engineering materials arresting system, which was needed because of the limited runway safety area beyond the departure end of runway 31C. The plane crash-landed and burst into flames in a lightning storm while attempting to land at Port Harcourt Airport. Pilot error. The crew's decision to continue to approach below the decision altitude without having the runway in sight.  It was recommended to improve the training of Nigerian pilots to recognize and recover from adverse weather conditions including windshear. Also, airports and aircraft should be equipped with instruments to detect windshear. The seaplane crashed off Miami Beach next to a jetty as it was taking off. There was an explosion and fire and the right wing separated prior to the plane impacting the water. Examination of the wreckage revealed fatigue cracks in the right wing. The failure of Chalk's Ocean Airways' maintenance program to identify and properly repair fatigue cracks in the wing, and the failure of the FAA to detect and correct deficiencies in the company's maintenance program.

Mexican Interior Minister Juan Camilo Mourino, 37, was killed when the executive jet he was flying in crashed next to a building, 4.8 kilometers from the airport where it was to land.

After taking off, the aircraft climbed to 12,500 feet. While cruising at this altitude, the aircraft was caught in a violent gust that initially pushed the plane upwards and towards the mountain. As the pilot tried to steer the aircraft away from the mountain, he realized that the airspeed had decayed to 40 kts., indicating an imminent stall. He decided to dive in order to gain air speed. As he did so the VSI indicated a rate of sink of 2,000 feet per minute while the airspeed remained at 40 kts. Visibility was poor and the pilot did not see the ground till impact at 14,399 feet. Four Italian tourists were killed. Only the pilot survived. It is therefore very likely that the aircraft was caught in a mountain wave that caused the sudden altitude gain and the subsequent stall.
